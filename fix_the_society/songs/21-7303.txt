Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
