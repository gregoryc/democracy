Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
