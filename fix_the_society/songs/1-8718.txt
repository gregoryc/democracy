Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
