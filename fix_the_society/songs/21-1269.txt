Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
