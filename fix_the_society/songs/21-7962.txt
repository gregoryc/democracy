Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
