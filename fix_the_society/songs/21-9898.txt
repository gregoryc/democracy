Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
