Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
