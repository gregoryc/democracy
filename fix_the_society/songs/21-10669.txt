Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
