Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
