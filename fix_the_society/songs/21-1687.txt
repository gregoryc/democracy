Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
