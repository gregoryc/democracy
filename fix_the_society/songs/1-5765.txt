Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
