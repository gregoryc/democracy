Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
