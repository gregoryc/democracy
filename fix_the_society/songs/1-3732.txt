Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
