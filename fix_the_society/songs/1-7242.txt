Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
