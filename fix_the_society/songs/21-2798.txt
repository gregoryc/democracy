Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
