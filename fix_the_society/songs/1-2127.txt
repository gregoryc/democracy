Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
