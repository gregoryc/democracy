Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
