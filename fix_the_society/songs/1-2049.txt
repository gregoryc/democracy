VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
