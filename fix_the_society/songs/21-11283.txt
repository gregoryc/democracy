Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
