Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
