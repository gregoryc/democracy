Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
