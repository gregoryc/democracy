Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
