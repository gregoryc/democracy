Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
