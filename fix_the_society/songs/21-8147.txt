Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
