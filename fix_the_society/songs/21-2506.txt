Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
