Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
