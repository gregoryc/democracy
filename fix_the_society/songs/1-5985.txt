Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
