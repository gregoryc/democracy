Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
