Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too insidious for many to detect
