Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
