Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Don't want to test, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
