Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
