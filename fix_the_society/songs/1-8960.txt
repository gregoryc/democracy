Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
