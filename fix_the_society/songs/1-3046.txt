Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
