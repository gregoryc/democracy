Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
