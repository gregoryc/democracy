Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
