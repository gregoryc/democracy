Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
