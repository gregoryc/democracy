Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
