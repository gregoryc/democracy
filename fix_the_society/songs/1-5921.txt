Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
