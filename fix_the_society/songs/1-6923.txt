Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
