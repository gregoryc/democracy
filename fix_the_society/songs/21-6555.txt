Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
