Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
