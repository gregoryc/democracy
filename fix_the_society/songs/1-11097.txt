Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
