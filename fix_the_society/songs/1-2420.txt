Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
