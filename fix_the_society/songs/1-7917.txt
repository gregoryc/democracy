Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
