Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
