Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
