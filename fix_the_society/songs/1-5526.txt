Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
