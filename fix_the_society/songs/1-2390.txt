Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
