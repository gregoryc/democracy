Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
