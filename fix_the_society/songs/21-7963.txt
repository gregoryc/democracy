Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
