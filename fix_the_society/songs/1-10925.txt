Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
