Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
