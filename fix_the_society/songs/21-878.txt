Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
