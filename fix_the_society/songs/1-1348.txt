Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
