Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
