Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
