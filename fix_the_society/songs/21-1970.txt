Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
