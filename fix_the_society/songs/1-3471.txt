Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
