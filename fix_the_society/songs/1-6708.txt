Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
