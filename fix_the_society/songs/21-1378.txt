Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
