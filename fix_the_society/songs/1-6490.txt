Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
