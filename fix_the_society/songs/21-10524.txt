Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
