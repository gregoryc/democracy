Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
