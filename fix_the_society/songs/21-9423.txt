Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
