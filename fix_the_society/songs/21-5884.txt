Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
