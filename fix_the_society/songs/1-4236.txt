Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
