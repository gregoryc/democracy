Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
