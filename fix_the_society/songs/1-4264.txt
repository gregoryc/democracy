Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
