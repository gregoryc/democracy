Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
