Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
