Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
