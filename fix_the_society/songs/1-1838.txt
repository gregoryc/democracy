Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
