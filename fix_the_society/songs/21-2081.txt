Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
