Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
