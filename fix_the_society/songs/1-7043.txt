Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
