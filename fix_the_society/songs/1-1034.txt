Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
