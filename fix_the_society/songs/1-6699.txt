Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
