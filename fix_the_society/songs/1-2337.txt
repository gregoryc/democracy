Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
