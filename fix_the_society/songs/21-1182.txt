Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
