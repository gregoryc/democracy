Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
