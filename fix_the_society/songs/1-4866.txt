Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
