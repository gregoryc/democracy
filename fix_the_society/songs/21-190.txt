Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
