Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
