Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
