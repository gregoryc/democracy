Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
