Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
