Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
