Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
