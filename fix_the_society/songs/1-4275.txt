Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
