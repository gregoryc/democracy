VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
