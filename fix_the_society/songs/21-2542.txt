Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
