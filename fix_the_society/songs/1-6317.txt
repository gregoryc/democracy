Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
