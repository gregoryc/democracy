Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
