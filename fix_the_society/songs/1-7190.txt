Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
