Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
