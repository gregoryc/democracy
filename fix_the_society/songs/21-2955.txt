Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
