Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
