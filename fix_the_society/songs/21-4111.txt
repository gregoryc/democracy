Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
