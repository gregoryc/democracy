Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
