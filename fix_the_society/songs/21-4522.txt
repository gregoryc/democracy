Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
