Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
