Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
