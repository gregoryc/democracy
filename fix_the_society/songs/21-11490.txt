Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
