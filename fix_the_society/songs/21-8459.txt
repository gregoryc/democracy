Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
