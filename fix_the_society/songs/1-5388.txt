Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
