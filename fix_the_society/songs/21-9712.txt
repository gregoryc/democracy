Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
