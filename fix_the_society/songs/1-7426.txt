Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
