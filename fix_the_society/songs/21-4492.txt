Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
