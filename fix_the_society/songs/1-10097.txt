Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
