Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
