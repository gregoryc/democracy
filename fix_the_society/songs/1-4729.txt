VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
