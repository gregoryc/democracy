Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
