Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
