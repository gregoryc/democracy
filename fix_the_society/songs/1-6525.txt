Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
