Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
