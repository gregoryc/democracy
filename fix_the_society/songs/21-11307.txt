Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
