Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
