Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
