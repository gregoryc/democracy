Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
