Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
