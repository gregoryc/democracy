Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
