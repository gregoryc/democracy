Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
