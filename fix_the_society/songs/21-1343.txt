Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
