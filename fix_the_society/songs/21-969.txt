Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
