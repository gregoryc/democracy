Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
