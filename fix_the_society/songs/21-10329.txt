Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
