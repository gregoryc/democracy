Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
