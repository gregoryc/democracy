Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
