Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
