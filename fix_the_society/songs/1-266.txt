Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
