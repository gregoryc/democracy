Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
