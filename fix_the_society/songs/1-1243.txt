VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
