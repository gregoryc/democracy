Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
