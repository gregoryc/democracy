Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
