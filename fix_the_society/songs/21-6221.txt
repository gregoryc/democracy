Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
