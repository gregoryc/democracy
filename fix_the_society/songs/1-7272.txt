Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
