Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
