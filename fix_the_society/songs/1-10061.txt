Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
