Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
