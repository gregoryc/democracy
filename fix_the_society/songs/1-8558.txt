Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
