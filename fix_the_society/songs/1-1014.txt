Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
