Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
