Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
