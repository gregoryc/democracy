Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
