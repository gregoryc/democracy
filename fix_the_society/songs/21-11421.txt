Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
