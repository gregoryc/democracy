Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
