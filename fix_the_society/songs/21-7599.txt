Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
