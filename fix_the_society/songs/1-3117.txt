Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
