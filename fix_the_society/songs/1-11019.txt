VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
