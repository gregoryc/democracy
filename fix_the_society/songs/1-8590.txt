VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
