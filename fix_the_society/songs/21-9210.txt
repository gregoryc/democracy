Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
