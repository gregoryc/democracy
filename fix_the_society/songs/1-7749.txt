Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
