Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
