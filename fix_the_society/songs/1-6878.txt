Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
