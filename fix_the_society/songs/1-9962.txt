Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and moaning like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
