Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
