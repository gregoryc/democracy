Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
