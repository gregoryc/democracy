Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
