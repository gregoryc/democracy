Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
