Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
