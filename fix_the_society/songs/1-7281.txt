Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
