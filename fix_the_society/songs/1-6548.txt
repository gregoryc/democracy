Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The state of science is, wholly inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
