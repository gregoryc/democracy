Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
