Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
