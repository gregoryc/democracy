Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
