Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
