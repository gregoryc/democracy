Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
