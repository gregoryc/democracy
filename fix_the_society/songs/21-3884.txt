Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
