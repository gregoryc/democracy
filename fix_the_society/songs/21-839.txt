Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
