Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
