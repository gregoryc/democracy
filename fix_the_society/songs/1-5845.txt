Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
