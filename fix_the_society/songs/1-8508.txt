Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
