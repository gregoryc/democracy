VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
