Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
