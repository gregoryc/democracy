Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
