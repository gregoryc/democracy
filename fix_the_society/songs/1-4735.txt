Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
