Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
