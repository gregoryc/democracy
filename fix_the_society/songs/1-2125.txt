Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
