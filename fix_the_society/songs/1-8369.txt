Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
