Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
