Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
