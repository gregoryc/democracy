Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
