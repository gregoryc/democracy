Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
