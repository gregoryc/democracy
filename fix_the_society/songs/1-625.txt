Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
