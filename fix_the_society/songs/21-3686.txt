Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
