Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
