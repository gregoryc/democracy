Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
