VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
