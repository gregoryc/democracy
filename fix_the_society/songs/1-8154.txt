Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
