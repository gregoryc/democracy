Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
