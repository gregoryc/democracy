Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
