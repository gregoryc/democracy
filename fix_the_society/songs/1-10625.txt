Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
