Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
