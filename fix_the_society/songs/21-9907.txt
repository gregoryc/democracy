Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
