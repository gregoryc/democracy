Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
