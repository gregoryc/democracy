Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
