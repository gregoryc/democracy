Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
