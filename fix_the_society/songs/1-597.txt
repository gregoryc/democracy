Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
