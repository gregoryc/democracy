Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
