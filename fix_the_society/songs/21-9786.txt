Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
