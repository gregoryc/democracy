Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
