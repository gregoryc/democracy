Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
