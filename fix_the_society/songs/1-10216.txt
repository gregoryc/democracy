Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
