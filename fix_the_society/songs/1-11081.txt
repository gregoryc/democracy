Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
