Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
