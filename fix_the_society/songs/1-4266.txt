VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
