Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
