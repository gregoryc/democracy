Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
