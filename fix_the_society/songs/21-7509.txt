Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
