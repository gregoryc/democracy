Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
