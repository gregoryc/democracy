Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
