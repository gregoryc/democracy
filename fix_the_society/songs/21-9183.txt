Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
