Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
