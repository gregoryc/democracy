Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
