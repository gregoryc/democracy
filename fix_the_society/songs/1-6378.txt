Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
