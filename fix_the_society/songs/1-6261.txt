Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
