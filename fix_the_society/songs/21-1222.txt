Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
