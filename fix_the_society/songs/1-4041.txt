VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
