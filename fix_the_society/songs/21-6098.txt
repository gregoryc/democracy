Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
