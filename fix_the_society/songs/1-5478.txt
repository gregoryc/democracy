Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
