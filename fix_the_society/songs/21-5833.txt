Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
