Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
