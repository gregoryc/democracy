Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
