Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
