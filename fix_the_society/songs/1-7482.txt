Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
