Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
