Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
