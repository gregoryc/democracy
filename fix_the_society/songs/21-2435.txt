Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
