VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
