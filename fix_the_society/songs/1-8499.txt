Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
