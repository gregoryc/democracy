Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
