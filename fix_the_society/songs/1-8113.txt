Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
