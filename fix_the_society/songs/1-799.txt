VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
