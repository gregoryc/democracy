Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
