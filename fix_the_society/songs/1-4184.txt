Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
