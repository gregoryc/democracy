Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
