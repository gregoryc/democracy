VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
