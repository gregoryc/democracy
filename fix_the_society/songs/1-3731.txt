Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
