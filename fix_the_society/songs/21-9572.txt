Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
