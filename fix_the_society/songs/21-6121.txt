Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
