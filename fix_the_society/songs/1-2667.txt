Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
