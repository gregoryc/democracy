Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
