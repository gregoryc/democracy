Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
