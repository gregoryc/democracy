Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
