Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
