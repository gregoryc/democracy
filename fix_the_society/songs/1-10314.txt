Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
