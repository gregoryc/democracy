Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
