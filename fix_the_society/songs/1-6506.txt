Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
