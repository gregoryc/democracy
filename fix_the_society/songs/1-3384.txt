Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
