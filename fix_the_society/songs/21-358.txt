Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
