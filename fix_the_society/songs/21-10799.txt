Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
