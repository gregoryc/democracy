Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
