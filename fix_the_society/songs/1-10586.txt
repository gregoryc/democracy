Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
