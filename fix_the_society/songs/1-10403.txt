Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
