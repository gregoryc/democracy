Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
