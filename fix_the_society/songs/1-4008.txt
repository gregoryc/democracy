Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
