Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
