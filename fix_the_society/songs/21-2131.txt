Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
