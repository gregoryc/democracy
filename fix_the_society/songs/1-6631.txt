Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
