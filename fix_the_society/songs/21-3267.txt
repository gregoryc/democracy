Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
