Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
