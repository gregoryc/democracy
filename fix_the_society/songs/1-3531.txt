Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
