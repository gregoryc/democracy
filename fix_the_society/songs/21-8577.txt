Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
