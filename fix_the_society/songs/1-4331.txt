Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
