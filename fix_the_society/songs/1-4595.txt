Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
