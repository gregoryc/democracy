Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
