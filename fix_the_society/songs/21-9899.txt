Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
