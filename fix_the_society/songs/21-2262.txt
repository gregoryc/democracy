Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
