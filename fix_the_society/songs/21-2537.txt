Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
