Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
