Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
