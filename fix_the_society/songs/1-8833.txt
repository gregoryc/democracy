Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
