Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
