Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
