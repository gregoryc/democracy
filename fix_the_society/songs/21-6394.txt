Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
