Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
