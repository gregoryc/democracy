Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
