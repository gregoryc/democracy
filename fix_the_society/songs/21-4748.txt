Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
