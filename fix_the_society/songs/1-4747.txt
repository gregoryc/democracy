VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
