Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
