Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
