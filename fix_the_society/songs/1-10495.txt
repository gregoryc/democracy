Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
