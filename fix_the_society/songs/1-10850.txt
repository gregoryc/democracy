Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
