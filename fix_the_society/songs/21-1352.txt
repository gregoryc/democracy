Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
