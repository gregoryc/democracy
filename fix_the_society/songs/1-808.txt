Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
