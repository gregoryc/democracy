Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
