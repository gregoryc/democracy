Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
