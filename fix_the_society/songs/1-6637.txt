Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
