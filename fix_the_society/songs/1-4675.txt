Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
