Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
