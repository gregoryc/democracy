Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
