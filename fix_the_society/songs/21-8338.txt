Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
