Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
