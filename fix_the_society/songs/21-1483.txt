Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS
