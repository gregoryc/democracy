Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
