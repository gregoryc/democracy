Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
