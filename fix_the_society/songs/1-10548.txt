Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
