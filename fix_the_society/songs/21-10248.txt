Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
