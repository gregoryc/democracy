Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
