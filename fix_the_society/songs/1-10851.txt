Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
