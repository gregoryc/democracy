Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
