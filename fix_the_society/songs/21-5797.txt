Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
