VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
