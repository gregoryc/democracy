Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
