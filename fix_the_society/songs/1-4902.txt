Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
