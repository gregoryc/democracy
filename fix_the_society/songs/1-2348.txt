Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
