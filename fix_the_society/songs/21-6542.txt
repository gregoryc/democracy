Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
