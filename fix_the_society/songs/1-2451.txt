Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
