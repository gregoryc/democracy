Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
