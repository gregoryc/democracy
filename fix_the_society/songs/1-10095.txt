Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
