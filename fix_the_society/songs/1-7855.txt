Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
