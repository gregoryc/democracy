Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
