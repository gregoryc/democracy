Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
