Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
