Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
