Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
