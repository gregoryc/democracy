Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
