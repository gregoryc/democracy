Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
