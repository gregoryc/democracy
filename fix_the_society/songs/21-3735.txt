Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
