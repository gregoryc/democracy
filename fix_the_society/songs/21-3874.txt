Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
