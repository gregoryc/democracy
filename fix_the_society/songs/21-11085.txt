Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
