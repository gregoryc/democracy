Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
