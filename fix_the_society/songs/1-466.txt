Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
