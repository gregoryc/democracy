Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
