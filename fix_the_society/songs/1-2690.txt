Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
