Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
