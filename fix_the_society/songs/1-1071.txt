Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
