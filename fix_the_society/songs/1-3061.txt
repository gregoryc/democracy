Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
