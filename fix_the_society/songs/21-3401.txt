Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
