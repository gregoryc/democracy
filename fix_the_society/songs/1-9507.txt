Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
