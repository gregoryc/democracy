Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
