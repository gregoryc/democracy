Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
