Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
