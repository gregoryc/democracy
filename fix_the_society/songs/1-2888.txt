VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
