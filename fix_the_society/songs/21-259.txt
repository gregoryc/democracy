Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
