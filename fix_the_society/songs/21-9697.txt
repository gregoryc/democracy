Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
