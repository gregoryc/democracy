Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
