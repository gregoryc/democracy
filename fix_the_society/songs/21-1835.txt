Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
