VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
