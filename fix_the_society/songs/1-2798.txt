Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
