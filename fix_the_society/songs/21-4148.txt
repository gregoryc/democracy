Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
