Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
