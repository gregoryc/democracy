Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
