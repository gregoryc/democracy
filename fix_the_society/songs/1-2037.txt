Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
