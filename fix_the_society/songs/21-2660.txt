Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
