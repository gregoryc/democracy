Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
