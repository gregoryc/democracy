Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
