Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
