Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
