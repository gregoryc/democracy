Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
