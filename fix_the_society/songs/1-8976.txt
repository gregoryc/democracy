Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
