Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
