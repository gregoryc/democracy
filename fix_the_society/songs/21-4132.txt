Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
