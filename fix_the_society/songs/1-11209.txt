Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
