Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
