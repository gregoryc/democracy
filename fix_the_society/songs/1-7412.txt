Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
