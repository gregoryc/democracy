Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
