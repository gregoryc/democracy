Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
