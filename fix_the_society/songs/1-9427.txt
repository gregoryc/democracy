Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
