Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
