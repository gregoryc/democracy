Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
