Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
