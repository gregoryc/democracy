Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
