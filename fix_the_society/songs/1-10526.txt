Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
