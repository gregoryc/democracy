Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
