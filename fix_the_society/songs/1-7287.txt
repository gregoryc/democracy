Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
