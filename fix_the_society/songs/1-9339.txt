Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
