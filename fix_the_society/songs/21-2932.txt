Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
