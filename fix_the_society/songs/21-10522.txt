Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
