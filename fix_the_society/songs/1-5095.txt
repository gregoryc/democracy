Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
