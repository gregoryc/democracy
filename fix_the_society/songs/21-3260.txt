Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
