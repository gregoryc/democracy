Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
