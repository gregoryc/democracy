Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
