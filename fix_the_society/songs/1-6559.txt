Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
