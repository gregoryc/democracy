Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
