Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
