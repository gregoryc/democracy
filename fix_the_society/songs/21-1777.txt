Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
