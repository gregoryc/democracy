Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
