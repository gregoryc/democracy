Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
