Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
