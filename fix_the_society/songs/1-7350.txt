Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
