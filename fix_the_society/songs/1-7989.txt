Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
