Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
