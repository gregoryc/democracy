Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
