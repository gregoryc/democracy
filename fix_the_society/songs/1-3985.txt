Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
