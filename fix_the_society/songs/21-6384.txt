Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
