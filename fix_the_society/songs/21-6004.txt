Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
