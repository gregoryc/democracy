Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
