Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
