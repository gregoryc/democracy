Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
