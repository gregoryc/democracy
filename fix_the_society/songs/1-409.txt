Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
