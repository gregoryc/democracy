Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
