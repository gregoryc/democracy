Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
