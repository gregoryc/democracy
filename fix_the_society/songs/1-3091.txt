VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
