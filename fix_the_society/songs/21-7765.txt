Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
