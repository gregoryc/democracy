Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
