Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
