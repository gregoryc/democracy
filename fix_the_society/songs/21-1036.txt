Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
