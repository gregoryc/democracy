Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
