Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
