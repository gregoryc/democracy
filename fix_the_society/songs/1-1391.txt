Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
