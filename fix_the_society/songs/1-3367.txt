Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
