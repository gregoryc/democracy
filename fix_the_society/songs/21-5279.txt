Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
