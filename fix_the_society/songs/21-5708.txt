Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
