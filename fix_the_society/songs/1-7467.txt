Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
