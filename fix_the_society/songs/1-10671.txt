Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
