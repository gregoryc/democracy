Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
