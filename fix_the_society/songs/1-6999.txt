Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
