Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
