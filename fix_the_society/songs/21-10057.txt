Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
