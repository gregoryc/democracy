Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
