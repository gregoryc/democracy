Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
