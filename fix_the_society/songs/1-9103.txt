Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
