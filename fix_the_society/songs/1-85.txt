Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
