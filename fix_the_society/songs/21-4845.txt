Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
