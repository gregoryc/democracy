Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
