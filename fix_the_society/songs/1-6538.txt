Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
