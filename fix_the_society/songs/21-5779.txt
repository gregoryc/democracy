Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
