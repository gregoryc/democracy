Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
