Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
