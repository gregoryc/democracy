Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
