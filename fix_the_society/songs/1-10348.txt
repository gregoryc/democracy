VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
