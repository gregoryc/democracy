Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
