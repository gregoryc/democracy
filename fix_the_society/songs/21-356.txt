Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
