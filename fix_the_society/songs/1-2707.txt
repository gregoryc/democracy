Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
