Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
