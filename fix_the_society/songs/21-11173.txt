Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
