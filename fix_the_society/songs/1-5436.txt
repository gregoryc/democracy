Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
