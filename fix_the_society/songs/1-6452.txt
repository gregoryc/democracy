Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert

Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
