Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
