Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
