Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
