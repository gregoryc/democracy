Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
