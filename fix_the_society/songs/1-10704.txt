Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
