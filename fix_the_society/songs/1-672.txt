Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
