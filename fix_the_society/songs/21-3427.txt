Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
