Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
