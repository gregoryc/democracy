Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
