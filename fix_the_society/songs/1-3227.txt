Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
