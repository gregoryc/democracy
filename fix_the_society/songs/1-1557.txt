Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
