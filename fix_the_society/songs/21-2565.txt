Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
