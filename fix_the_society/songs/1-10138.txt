Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
