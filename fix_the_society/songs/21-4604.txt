Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
