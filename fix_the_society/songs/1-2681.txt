Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
