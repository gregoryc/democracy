Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
