Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
