Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
