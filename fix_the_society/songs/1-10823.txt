Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
