Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
