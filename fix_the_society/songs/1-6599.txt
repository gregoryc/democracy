Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
