Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
