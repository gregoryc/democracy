Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
