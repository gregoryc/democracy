Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
