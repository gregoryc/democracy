Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
