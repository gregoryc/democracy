Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
