Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
