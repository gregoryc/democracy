Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
