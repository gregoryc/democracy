Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
