Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
