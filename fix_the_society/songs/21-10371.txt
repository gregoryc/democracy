Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
