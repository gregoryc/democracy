Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
