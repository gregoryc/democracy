Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
