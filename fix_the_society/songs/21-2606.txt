Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
