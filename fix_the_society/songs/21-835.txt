Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
