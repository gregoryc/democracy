Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
