Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
