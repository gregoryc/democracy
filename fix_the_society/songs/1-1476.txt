Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
