Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
