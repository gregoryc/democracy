Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
