Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
