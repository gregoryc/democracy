Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
