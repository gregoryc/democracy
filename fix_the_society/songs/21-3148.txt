Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
