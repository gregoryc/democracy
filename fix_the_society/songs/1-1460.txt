Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
