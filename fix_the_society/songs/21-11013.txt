Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
