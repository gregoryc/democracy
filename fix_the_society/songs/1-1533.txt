Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
