Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
