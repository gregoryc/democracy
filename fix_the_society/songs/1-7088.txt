Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
