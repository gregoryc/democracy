Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
