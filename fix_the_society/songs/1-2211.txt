Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
