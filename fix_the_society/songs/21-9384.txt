Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
