Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
