Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
