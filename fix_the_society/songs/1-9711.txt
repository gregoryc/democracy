Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
