Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
