Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
