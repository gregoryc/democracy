Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
