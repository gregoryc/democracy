Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
