Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
