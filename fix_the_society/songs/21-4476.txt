Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
