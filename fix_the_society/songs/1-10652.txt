Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
