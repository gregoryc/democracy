Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
