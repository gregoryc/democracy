Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
