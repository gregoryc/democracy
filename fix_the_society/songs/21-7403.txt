Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
