Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
