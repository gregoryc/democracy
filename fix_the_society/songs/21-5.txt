Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
