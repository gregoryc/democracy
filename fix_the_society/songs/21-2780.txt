Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
