Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
