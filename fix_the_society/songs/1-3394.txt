Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
