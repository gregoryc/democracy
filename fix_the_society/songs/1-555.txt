VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
