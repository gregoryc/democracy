Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS
