Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
