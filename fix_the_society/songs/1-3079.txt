Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
