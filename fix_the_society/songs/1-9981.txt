VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
