Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
