Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
