Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
