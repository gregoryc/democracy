Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
