Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
