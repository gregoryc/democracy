Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
