Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
