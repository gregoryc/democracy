Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
