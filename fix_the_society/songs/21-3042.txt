Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
