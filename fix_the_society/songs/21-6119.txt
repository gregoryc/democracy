Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
