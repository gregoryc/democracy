Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
