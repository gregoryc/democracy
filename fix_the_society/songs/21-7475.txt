Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
