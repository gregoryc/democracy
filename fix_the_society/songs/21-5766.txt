Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
