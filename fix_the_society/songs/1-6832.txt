Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
