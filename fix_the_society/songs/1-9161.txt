Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
