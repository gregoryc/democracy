Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
