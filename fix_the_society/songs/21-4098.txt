Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
