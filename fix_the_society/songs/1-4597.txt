Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
