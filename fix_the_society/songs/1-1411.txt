Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
