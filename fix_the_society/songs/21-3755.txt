Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
