Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
