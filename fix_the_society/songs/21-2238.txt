Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
