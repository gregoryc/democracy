Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
