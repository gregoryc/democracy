Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
