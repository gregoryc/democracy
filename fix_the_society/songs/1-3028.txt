Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
