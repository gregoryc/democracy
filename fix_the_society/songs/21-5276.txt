Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
