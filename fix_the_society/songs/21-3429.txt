Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
