Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
