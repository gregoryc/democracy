Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
