Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
