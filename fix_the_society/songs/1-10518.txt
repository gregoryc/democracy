VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
