Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
