Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
