Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
