Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
