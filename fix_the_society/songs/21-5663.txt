Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
