Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
