Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
