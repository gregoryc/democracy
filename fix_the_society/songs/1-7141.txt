Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
