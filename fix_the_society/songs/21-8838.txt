Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
