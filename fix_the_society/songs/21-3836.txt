Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
