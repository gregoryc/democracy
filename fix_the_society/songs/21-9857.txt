Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
