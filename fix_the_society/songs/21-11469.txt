Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
