Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
