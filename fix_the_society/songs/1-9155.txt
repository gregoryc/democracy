Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
