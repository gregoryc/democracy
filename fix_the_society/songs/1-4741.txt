Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
