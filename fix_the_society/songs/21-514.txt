Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
