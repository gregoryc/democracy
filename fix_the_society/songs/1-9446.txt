Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
