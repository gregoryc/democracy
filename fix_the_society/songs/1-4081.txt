Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
