Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
