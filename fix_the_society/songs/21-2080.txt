Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
