Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
