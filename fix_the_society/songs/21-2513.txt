Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
