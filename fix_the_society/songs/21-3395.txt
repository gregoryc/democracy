Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
