Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
