Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
