Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
