VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
