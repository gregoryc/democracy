Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
