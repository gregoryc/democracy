Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
