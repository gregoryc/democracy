Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
