VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
