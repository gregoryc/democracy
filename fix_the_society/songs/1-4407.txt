Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
