Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
