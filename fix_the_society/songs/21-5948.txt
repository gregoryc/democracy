Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
