Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
