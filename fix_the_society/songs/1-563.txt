Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
