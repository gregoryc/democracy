Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
