Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
