Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
