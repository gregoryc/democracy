Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
