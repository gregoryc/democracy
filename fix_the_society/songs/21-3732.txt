Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
