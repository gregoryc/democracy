Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
