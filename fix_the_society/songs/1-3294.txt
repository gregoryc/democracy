Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
