Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
