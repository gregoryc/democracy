Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
