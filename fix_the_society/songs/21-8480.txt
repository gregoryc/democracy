Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
