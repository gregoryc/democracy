Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
