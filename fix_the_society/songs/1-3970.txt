Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
