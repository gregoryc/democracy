Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
