Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
