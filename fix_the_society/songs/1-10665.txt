Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
