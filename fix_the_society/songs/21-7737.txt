Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
