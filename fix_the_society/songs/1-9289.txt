Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
