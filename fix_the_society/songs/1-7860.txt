Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
