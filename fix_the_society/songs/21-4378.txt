Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
