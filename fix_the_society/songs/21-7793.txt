Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
