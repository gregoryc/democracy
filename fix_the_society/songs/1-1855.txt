Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
