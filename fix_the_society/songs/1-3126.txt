Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
