Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
