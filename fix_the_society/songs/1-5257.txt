Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
