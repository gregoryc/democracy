Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
