Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
