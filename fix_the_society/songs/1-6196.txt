VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
