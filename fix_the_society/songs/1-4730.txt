VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
