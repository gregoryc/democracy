Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
