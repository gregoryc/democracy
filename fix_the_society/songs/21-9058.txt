Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
