Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
