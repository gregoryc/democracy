Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
