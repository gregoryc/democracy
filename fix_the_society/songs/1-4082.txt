Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
