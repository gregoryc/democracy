Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
