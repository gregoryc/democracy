Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
