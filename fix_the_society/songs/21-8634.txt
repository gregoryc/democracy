Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
