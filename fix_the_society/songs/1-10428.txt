Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
