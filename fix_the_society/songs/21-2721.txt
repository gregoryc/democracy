Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
