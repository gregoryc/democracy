Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
