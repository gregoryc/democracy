Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
