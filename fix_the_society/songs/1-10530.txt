Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
