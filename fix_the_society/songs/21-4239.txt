Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
