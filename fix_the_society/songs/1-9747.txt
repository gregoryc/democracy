Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
