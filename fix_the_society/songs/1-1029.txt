Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
