Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
