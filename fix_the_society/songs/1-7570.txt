Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
