Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
