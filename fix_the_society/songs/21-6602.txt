Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
