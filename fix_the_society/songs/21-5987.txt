Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
