Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
