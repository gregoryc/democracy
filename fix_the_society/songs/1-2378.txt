Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
