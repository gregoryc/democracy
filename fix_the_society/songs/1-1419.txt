Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
