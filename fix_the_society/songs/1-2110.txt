Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
