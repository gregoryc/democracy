Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
