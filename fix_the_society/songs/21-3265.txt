Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
