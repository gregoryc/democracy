Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
