Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
