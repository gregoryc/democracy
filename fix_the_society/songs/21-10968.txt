Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
