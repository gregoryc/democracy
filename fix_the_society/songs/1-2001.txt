Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
