Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
