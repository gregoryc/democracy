Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
