Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
