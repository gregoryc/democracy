Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
