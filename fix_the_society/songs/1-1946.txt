Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
