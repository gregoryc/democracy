Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
