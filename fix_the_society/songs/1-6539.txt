Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
