VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
