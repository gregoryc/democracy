Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
