Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
