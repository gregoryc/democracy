Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
