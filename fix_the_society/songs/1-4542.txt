VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
