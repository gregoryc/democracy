Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
