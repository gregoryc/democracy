Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
