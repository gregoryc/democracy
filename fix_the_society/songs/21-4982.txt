Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
