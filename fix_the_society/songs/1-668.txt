Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
