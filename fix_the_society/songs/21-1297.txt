Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
