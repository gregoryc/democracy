Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
