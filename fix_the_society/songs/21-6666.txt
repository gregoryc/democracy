Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
