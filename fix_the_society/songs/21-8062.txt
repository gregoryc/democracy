Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
