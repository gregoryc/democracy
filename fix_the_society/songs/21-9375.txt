Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
