Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
