VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
