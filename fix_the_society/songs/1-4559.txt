Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
