Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
