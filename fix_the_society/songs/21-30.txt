Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
