Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
