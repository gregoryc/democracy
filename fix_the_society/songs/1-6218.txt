Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
