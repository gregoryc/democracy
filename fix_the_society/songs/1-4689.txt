Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
