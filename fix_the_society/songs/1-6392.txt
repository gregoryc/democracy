VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
