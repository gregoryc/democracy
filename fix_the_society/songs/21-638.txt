Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
