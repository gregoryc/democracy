Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
