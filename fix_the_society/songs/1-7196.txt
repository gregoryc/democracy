Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
