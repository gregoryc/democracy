Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
