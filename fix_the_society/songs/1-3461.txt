Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
