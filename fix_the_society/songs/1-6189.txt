Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
