Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
