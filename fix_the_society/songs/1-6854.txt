Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
