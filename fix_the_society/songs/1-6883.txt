Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
