Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
