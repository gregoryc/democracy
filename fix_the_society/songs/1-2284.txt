Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
