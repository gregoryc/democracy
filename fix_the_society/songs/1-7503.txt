Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their own principles are something they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
