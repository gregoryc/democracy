Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
