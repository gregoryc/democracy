Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
