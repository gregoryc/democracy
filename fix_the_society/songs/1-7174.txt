Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
