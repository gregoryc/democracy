Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
