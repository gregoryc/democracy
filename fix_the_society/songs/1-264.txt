Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
