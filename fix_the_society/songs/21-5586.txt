Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
