Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
