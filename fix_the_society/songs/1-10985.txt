Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
