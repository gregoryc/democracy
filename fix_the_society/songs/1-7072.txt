Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
