Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
