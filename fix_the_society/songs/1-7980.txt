Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
