Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
