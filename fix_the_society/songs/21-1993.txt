Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
