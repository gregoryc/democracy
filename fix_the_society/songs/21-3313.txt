Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
