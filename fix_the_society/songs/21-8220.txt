Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
