Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
