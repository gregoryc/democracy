Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
