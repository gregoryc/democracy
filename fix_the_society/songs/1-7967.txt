Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
