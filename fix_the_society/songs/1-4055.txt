Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
