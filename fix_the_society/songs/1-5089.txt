Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
