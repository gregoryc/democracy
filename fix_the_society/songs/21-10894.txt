Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
