Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
