Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
