Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
