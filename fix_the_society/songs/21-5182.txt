Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
