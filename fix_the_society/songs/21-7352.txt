Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
