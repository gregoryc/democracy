Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
