Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
