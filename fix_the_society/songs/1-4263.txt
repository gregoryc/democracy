Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
