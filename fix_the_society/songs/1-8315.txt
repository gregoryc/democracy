Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
