Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
