Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
