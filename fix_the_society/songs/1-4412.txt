Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
