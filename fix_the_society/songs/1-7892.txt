Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
