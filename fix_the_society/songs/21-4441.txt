Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
