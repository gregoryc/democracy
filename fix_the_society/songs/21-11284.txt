Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
