Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
