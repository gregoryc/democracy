Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
