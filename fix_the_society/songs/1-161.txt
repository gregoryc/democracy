Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
