Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
