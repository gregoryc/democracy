Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
