Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
