Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
