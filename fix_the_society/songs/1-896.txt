VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
