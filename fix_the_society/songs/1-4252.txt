Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
