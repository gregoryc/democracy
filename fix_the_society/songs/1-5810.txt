VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
