Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
