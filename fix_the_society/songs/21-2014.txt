Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
