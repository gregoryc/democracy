Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
