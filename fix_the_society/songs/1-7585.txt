Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
