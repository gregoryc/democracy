Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
