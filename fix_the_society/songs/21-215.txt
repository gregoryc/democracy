Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
