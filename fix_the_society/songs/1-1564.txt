Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
