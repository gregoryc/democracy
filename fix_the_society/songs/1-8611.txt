Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
