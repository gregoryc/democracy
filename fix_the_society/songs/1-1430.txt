Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
