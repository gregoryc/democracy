Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
