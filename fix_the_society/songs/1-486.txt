VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
