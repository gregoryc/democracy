Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
