Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
