Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
