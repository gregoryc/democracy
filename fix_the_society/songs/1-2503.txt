Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
