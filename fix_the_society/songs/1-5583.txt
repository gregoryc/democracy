Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
