Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
