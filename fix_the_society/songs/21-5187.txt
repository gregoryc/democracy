Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
