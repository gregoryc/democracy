Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
