Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
