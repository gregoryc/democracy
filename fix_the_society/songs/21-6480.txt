Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
