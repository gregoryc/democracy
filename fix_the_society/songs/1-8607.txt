Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
