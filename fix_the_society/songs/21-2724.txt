Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
