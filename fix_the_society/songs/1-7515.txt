Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
