Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
