Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
