Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
