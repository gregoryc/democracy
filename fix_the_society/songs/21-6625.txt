Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
