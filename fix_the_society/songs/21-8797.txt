Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
