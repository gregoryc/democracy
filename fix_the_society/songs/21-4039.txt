Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
