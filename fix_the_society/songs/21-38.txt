Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
