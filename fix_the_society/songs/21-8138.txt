Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
