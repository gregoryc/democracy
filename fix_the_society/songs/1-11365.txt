Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
