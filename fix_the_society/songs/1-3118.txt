Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
