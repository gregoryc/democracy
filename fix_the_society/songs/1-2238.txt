Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
