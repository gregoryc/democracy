Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
