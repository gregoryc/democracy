Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
