VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
