Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
