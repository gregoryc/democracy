Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
