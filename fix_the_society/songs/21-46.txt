Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
