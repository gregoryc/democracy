Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
