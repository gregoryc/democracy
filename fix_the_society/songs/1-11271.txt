Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
