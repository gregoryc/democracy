Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
