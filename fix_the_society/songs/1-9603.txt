VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
