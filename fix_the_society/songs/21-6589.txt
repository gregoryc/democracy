Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
