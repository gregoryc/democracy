Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
