Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
