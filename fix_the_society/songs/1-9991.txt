Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
