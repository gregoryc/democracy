Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
