Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
