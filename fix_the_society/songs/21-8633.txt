Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
