Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
