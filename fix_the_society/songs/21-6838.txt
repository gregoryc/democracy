Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
