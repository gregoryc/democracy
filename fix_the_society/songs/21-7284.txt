Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
