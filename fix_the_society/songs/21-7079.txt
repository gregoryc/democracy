Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
