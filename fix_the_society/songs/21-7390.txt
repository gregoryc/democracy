Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
