Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
