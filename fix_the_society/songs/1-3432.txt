Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
