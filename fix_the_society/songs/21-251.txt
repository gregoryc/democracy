Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
