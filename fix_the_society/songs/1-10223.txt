Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
