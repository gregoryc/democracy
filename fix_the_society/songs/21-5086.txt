Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
