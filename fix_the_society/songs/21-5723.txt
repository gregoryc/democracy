Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
