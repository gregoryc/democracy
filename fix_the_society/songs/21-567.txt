Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
