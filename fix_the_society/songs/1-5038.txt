Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
