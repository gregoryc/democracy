Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
