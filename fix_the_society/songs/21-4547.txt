Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
