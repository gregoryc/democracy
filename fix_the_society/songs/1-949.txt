Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
