Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
