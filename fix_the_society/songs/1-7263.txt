Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
