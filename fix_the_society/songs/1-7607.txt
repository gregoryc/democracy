Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
