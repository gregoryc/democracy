VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
