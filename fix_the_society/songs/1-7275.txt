Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
