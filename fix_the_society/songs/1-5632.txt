Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
