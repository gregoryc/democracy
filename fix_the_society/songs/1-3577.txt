Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
