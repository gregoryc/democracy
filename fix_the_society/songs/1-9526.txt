Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
