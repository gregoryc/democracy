Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
