Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
