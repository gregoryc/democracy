Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
