Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
