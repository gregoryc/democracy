Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
