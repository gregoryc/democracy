Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
