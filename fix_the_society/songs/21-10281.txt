Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
