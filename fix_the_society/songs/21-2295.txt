Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
