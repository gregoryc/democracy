Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
