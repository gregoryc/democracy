Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
