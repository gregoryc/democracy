Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
