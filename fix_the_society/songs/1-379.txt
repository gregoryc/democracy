Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
