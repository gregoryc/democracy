Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
