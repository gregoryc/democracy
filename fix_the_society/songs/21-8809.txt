Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
