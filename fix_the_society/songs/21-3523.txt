Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
