Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
