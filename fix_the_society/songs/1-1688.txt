VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
