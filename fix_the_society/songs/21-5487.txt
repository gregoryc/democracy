Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
