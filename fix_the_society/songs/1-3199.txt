Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
