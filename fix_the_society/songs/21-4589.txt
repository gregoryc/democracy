Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
