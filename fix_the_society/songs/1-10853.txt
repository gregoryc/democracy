Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
