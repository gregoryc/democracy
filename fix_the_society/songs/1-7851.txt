Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
