Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
