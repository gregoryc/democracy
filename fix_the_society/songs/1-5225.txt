Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
