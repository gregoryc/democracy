VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
