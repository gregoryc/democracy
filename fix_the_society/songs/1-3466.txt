Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
