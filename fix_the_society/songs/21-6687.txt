Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
