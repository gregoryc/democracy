Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
