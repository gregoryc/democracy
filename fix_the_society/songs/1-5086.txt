Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Whining and moaning like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
