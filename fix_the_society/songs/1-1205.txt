Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
