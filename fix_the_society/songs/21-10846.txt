Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
