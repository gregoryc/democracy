Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
