Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
