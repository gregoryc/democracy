Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
