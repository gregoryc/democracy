Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
