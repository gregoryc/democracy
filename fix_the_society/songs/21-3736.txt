Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
