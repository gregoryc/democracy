Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
