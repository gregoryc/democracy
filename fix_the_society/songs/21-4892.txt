Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
