Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
