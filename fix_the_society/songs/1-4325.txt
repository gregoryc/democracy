Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
