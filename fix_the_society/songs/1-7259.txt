Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
