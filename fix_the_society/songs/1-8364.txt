Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
