VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
