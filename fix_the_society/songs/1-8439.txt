Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
