Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
