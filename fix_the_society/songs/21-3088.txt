Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
