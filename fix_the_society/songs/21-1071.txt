Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
