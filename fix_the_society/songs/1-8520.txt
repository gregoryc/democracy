Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
