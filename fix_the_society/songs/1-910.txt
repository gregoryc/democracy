Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
