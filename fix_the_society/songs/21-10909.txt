Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
