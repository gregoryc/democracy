Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
