Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
