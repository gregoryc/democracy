Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
