Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
