Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
