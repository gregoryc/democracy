Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
