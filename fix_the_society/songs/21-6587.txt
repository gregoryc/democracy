Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
