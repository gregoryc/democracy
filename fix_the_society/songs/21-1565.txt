Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
