Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
