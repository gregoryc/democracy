Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
