Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
