Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
