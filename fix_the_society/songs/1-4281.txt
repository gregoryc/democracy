Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
