Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
