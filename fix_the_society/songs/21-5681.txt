Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
