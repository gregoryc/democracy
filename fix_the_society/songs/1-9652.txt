Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
