Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
