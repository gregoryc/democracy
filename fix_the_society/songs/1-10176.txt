Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
