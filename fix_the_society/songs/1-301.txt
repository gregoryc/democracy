VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
