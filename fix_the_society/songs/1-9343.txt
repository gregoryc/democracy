Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
