Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
