Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
