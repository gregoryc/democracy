Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
