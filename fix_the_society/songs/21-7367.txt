Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
