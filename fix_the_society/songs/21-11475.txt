Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
