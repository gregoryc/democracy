Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
