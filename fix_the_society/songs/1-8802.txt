Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
