Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
