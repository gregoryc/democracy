Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
