Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
