Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
