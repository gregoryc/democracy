Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
