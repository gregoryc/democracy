Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
