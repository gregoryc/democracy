Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
