Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
