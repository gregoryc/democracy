Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
