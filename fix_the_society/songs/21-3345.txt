Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
