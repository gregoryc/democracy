Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
