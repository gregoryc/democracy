Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
