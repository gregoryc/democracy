Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
