Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
