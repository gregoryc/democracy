Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
