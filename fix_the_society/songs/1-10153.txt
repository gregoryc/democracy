Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
