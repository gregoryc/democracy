Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
