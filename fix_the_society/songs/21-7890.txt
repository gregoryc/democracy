Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
