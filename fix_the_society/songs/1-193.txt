Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
