Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
