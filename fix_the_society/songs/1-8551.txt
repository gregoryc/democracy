Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
