Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
