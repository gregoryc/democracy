Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
