Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
