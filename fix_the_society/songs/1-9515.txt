Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
