Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
