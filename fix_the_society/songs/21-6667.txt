Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
