VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
