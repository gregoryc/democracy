Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
