Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
