Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
