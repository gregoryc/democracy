Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
