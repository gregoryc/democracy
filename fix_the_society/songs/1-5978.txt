Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
