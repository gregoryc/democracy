Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
