Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
