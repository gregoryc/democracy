Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
