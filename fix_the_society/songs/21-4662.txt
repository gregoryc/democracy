Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
