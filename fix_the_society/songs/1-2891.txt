Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
