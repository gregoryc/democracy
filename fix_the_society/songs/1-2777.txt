Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
