Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
