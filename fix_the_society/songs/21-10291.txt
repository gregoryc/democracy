Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
