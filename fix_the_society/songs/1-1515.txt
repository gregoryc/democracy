Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
