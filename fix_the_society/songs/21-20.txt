Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
