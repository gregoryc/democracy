Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
