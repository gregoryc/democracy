Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
