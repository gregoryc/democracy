Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
