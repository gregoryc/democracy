Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
