Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
