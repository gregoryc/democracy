Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
