Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
