Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
