Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
