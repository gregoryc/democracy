VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
