Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
