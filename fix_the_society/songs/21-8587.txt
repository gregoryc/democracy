Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
