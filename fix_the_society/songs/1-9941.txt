Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
