Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
