Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
