Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
