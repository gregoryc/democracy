Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
