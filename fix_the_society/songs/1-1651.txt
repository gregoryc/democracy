Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
