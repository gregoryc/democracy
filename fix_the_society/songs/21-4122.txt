Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
