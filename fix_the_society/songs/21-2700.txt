Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
