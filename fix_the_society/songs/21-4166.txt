Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
