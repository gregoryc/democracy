Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
