VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
