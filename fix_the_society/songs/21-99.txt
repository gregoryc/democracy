Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
