Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
