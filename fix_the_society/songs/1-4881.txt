VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
