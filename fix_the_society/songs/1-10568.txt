Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
