Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
