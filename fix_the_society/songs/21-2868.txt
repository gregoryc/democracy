Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
