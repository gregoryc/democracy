Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
