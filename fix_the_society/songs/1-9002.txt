Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
