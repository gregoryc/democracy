Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
