Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
