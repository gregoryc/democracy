VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
