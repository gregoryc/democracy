VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
