Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
