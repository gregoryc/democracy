Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
