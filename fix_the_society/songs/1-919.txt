Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
