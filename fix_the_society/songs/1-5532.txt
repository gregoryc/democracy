Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
