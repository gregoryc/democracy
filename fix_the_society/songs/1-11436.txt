Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
