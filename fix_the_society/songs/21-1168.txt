Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
