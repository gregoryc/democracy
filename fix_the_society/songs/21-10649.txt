Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
