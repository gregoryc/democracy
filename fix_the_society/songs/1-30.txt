Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
