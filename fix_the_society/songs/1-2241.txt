Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
