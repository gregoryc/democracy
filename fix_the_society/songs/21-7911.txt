Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
