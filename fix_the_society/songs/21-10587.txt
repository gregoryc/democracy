Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
