Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
