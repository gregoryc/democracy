Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
