Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
