Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
