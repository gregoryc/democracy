Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
