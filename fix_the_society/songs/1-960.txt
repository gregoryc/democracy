Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
