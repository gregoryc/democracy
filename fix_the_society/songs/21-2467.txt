Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
