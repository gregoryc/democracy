Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
