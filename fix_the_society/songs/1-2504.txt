Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
