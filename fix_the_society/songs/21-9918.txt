Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
