Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
