Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
