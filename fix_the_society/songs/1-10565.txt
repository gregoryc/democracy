Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
