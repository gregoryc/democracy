Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
