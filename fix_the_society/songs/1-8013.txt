Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
