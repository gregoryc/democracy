Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
