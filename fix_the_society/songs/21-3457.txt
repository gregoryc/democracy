Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
