Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
