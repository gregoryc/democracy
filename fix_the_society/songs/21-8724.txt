Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
