Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
