Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
