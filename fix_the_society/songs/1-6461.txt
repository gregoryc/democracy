Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
