Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
