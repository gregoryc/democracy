Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
