Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
