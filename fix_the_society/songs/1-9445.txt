Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
