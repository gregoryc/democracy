Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
