Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Evading conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
