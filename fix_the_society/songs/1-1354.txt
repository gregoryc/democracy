Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
