Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
