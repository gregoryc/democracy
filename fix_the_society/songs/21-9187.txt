Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
