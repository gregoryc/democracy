Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
