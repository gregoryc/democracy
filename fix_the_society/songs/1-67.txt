VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
