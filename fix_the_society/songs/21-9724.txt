Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
