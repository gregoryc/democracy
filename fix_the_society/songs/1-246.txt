Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
