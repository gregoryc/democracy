Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
