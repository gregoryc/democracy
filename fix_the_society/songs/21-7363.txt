Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
