Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
