Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
