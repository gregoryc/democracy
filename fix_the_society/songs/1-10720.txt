Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
