Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
