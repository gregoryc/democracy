Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
