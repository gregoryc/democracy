Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
