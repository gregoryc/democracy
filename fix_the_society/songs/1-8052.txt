Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
