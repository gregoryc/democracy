Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
