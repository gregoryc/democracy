Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
