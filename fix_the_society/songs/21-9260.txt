Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
