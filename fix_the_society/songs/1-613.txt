Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
