Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
