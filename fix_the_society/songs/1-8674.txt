Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
