Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
