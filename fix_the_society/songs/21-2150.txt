Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
