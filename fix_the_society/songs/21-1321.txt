Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
