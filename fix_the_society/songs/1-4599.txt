Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
