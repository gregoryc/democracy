Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
