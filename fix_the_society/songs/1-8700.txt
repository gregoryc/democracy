Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
