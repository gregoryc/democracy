Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
