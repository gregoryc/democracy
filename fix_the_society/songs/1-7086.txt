Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
