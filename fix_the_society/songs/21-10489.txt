Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
