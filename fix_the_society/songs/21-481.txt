Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
