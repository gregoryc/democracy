Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
