Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
