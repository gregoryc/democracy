Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
