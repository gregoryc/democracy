Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
