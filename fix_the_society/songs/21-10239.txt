Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
