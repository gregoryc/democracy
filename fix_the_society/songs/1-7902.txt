Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
