Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
