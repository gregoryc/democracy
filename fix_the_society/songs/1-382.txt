Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
