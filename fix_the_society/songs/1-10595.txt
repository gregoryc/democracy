Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
