Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
