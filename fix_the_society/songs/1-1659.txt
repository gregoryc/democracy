Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
