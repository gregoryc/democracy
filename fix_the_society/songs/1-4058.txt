VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
