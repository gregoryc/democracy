Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
