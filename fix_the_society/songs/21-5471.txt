Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
