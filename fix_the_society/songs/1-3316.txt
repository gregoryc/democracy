Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
