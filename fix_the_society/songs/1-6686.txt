Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
