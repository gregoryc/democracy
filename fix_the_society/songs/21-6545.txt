Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
