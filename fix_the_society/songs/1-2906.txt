Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
