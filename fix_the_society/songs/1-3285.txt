Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
