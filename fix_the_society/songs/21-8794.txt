Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
