Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
