Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
