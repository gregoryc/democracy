Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
