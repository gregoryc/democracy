Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
