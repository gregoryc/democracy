Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
