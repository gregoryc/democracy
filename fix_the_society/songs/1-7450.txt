Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
