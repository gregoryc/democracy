Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
