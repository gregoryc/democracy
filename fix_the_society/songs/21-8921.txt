Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
