Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
