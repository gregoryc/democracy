Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
