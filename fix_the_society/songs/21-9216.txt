Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
