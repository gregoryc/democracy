Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
