Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
