Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
