Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
