Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
