Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
