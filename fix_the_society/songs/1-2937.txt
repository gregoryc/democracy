Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
