Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
