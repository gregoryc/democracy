Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
