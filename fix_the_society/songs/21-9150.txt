Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
