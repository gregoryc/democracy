Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
