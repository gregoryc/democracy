Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
