VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
