Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
