Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
