Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
