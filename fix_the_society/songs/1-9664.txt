Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
