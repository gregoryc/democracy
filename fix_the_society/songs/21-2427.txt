Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
