Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
