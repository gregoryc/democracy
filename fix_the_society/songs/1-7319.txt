Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
