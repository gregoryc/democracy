Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
