VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
