Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
