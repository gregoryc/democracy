Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
