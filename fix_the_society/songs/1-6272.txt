Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
