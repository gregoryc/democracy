Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
