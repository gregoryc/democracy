Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
