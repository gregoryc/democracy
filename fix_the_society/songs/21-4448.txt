Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
