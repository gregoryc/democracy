Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
