Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
