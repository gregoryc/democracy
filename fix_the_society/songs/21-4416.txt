Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
