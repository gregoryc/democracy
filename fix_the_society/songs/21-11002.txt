Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
