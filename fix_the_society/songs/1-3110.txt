Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
