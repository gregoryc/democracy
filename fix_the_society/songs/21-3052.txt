Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
