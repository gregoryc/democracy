Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
