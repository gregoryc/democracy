Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
