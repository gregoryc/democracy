Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
