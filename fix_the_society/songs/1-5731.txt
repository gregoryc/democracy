Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
