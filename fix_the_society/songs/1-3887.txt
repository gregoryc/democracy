Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
