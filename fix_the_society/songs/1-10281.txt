Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
