Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
