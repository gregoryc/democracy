Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
