Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
