Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
