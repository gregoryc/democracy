Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
