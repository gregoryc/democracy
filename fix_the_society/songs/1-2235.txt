Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
