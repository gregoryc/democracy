Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
