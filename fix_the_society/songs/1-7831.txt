Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
