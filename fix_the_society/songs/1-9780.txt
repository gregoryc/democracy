Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
