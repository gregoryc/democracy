Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
