Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
