Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
