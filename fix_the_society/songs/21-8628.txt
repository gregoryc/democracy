Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
