Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
