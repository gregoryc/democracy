Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
