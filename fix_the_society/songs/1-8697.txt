Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
