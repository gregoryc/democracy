Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
