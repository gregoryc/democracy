Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
