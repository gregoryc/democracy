Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
