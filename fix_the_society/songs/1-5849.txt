Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
