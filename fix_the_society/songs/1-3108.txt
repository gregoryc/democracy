Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
