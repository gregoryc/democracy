Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
