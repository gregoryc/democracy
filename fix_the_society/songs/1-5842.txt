Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
