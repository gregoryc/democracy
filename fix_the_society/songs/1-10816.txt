VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
