Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
