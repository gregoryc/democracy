Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
