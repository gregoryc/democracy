VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
