Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
