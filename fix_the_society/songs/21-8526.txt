Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
