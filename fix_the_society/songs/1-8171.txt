Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
