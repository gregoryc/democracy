Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
