Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
