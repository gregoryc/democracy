Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
