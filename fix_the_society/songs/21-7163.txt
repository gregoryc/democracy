Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
