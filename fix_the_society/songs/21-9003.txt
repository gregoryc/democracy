Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
