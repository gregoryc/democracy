Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
