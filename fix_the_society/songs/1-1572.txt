Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
