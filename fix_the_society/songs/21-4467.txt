Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
