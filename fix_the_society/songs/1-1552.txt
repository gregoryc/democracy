VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
