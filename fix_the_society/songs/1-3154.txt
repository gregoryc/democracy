Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
