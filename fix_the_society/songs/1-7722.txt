Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
