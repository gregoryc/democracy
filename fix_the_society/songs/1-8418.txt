Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
