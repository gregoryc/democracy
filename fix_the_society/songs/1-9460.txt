Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
