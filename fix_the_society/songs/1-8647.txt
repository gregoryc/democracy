Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
