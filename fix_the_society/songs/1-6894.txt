VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
