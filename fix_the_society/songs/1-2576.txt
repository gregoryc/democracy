Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
