Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
