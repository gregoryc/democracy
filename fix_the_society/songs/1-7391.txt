Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
