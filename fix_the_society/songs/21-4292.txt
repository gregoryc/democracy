Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
