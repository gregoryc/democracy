Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

An open conversation, they always divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
