Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
