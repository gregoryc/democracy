Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
