Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
