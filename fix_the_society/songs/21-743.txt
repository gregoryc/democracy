Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
