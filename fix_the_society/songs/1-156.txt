Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
