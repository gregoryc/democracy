Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
