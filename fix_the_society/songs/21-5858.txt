Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
