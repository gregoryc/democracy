Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
