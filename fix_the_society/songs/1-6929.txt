Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
