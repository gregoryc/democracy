Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
