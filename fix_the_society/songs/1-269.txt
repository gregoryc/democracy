Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too insidious for many to detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
