Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
