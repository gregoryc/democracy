VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
