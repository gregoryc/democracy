Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
