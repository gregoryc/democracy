Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
