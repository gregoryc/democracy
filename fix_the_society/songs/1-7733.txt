Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
