VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
