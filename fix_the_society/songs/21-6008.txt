Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
