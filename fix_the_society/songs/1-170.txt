Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
