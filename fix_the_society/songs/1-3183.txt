VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
