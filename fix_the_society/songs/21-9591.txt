Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
