Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
