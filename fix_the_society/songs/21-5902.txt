Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
