Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
