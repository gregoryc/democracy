VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
