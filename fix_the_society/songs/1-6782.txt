Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
