Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
