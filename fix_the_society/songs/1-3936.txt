Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
