Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
