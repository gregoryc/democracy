Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
