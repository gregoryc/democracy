Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
