Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
