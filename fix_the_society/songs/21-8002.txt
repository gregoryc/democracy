Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
