Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
