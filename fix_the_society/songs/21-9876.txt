Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
