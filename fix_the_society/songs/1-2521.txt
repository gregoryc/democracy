Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
