Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
