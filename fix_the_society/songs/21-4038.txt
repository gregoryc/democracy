Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
