Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
