Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
