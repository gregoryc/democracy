Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
