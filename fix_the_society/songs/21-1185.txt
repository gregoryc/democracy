Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
