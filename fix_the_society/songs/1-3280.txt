Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
