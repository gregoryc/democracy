VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
