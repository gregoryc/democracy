Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
