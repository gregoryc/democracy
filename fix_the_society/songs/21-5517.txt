Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
