Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
