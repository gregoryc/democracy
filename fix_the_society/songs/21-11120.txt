Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
