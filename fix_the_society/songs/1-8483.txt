Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
