Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
