Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
