Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
