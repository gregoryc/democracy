Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
