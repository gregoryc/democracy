Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
