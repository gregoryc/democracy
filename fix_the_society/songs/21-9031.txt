Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
