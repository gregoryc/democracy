Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
