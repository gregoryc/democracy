Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
