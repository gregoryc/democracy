Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
