Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
