Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
