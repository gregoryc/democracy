Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
