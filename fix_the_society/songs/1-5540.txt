Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
