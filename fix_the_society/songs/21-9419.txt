Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
