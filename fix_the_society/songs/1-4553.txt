Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
