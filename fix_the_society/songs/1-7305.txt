Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
