Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
