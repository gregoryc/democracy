Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
