Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
