Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
