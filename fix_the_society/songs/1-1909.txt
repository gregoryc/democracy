Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
