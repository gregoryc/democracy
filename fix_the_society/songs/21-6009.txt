Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
