Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
