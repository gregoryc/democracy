Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
