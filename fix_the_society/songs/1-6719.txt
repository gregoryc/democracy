Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is plain, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
