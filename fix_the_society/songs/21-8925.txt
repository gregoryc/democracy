Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
