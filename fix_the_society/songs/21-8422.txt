Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
