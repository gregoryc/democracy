Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
