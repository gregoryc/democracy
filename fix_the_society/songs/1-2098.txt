Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
