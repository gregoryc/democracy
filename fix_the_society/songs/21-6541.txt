Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
