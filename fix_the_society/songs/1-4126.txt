Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
