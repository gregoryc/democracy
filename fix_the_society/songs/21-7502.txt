Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
