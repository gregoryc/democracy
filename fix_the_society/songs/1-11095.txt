Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
