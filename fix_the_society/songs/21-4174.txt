Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
