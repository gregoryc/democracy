Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
