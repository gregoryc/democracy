Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
