Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
