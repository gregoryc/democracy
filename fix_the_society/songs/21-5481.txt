Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
