Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
