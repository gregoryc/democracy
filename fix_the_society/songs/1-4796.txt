Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
