Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
