Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
