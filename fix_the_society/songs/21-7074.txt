Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
