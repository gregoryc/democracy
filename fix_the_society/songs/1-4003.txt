Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
