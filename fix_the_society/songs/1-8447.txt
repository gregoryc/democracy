Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
