Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
