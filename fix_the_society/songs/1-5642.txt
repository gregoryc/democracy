Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
