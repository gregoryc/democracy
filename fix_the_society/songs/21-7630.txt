Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
