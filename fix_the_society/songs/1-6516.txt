Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
