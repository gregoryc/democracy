Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
