Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
