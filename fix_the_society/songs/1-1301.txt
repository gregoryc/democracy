Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
