Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
