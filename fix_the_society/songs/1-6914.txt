Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
