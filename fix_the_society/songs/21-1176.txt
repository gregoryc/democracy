Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
