Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
