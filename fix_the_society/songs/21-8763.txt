Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
