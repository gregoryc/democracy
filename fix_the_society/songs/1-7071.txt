Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
