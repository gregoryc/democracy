Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
