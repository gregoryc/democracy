Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
