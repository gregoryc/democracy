Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
