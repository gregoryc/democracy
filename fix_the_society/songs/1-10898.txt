Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
