Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
