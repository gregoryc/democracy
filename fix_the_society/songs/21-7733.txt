Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
