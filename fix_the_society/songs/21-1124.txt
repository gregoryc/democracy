Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
