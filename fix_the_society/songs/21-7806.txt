Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
