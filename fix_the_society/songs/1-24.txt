Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
