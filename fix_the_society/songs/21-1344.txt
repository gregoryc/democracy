Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
