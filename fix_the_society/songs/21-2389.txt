Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
