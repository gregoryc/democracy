Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
