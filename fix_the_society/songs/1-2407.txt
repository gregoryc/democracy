Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
