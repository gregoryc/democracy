Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
