Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
