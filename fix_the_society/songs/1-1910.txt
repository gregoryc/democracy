Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too insidious for many to detect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too insidious for many to detect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
