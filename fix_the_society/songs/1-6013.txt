Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
