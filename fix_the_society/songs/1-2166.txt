Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
