Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
