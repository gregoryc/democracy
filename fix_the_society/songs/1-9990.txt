Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
