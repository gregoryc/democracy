Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
