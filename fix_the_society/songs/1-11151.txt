Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
