Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
