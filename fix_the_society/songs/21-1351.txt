Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
