Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
