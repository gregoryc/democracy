VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
