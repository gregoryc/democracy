Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
