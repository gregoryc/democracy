Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
