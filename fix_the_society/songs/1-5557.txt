Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
