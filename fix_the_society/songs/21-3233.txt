Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
