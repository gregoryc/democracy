Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
