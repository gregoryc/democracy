Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
