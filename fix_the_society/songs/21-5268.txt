Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
