Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
