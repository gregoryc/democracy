Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
