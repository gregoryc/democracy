Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
