Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
