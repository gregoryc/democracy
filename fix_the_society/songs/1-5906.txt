Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
