Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
