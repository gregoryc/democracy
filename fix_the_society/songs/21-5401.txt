Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
