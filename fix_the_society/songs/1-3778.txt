Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
