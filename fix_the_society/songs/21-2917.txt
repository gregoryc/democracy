Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
