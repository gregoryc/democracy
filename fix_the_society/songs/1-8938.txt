Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
