Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
