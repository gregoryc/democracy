Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
