VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
