Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
