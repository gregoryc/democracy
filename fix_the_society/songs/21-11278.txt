Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
