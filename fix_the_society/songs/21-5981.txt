Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
