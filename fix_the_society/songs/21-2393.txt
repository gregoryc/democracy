Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
