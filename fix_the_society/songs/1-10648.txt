Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
