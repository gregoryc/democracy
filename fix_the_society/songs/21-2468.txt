Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
