VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
