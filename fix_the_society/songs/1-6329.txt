Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
