Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
