Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
