Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
