Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
