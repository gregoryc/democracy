Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
