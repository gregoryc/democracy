Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
