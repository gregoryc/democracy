Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
