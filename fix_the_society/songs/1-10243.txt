Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
