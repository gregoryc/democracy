Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
