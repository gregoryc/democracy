Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
