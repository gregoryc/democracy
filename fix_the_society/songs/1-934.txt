Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
