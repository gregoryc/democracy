Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
