Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
