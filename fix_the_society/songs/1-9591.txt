Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
