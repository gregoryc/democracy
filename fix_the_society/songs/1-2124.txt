Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
