Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
