Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
