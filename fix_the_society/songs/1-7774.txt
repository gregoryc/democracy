Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
