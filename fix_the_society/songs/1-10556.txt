Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
