Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
