Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
