Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
