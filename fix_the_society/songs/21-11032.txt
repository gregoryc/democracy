Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
