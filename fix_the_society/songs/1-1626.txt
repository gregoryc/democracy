Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
