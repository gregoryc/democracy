Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
