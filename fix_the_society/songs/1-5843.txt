Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
