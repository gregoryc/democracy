Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
