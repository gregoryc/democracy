Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
