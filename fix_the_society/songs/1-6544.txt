VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
