Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
