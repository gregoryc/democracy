Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
