Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
