Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
