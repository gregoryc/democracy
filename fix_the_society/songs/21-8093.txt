Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
