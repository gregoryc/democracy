VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
