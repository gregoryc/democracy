Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
