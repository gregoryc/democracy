Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
