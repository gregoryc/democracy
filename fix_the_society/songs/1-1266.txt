Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
