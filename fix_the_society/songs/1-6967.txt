Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
