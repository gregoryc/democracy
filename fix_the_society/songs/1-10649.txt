Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
