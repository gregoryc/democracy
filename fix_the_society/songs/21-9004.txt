Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
