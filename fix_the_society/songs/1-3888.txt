Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
