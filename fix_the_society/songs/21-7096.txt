Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
