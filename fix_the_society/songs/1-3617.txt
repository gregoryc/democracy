Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
