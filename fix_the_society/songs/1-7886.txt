Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
