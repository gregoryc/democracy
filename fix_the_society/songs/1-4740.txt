Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
