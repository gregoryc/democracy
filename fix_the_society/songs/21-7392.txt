Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
