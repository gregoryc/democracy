Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
