Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
