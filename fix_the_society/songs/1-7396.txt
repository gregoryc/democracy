Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
