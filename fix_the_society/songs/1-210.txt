Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
