Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
