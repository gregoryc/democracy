Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
