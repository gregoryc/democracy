Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
