Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
