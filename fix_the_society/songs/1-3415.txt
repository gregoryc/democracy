Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is plain, anyone can detect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is plain, anyone can detect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
