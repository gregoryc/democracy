Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
