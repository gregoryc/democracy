Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
