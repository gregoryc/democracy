VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
