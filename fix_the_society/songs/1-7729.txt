Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS
