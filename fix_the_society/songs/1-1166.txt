VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
