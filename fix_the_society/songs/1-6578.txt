Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
