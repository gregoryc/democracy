Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
