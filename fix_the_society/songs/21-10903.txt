Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
