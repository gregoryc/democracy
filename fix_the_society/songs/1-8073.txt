VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
