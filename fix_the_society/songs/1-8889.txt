Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
