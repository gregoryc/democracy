Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
