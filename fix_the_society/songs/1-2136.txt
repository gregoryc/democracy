Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
