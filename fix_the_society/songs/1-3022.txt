Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
