Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
