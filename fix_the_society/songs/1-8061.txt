Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
