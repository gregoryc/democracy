Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
