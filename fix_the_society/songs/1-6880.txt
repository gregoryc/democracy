Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
