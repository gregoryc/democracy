Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
