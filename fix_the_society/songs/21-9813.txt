Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
