Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
