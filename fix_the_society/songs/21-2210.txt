Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
