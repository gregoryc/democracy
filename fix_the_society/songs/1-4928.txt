Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
