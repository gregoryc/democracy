Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
