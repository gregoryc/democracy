Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
