Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
