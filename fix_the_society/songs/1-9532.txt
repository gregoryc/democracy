Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
