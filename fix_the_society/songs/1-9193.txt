Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
