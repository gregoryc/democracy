Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
