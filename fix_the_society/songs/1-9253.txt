Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
