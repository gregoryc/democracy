Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
