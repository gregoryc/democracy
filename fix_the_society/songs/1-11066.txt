Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
