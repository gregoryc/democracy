Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
