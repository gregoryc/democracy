Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
