Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
