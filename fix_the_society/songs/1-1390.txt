Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
