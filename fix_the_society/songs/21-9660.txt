Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
