Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
