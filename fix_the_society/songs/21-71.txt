Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
