Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
