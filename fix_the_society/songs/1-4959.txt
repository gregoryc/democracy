Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
