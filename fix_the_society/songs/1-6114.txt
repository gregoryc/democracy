VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
