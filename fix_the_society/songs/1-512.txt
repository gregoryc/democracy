Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
