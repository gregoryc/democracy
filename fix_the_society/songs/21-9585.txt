Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
