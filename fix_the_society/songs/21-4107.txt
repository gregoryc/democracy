Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
