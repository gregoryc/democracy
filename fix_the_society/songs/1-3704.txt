Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
