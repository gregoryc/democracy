Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
