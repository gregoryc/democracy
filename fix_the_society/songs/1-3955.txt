VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
