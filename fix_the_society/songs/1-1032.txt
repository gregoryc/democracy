Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
