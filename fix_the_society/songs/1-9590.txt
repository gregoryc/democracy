Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
