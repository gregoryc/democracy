Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
