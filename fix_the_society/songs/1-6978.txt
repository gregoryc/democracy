Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
