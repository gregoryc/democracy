Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
