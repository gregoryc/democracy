Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
