Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
