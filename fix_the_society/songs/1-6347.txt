VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
