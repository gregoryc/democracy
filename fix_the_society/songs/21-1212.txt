Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
