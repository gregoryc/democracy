Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
