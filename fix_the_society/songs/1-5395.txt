Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
