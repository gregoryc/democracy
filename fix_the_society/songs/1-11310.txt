Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
