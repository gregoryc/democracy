Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
