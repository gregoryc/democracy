Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
