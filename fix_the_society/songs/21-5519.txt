Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
