Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
