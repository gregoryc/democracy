Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
