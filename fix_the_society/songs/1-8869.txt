Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
