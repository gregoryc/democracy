Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
