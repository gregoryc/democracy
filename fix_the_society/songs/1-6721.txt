Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
