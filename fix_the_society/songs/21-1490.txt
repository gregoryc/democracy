Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
