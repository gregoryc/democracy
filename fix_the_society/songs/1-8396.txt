Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
