Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
