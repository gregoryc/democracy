Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
