Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
