Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
