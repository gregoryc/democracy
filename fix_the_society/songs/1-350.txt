Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
