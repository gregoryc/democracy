Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
