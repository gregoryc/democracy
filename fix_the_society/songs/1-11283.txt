Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Don't have to do with ego or id

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
