Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
