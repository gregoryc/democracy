Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
