Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
