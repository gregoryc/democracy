Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
