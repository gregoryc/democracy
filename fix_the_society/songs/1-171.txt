VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
