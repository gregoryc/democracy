Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
