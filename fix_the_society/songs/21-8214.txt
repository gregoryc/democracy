Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
