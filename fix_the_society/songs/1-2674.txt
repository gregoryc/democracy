VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
