Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
