Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
