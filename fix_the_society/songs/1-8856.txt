Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
