Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
