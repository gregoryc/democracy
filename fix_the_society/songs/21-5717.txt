Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
