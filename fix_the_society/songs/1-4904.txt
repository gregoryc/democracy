VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
