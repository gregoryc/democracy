Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
