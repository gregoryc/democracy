Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
