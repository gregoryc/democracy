Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
