Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
