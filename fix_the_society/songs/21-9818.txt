Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
