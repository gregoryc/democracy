Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
