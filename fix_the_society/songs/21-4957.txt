Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
