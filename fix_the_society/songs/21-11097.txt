Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
