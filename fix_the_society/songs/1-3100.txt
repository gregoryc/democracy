Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
