Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
