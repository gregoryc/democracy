Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
