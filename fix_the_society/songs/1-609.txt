Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
