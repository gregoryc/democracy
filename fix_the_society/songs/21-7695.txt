Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
