Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
