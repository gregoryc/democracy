Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
