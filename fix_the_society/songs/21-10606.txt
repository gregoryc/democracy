Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
