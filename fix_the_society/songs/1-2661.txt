Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They do junk, they do dirt

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
