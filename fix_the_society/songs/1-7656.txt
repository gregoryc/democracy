Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
