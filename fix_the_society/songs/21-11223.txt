Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
