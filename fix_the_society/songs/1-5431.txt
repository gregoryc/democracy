Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
