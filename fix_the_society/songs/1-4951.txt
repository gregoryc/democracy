Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
