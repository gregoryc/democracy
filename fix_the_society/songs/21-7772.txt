Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
