Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
