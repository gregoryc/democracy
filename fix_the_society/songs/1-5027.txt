Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
