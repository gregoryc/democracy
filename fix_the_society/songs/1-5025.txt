Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
