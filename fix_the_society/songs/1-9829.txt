Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
