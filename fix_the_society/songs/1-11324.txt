Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
