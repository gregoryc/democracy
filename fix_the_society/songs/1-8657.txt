Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
