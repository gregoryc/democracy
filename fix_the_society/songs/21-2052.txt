Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
