Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
