Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
