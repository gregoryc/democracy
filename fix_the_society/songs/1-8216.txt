Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
