Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
