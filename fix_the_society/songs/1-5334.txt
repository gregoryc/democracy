Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
