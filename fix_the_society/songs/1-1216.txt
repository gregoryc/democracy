Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
