Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
