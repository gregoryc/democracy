Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
