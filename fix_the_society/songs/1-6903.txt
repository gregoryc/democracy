Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
