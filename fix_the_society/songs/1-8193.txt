Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
