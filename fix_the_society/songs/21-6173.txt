Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
