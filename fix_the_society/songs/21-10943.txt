Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
