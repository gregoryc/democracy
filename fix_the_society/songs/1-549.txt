Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
