Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
