Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
