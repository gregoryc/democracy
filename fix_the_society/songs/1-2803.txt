Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
