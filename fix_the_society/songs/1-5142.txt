Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
