Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
