Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
