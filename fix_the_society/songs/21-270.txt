Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
