Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
