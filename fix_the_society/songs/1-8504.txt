VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
