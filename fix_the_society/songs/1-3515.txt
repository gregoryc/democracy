Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
