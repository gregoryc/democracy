Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
