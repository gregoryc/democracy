Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
