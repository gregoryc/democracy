Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
