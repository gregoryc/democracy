Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
