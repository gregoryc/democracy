Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
