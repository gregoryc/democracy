Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
