Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
