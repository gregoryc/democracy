Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
