Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
