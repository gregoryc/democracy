Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
