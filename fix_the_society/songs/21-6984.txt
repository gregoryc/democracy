Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
