Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
