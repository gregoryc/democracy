Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
