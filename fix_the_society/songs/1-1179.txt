VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
