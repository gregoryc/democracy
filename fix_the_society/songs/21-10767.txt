Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
