Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
