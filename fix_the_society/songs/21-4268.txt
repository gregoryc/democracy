Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
