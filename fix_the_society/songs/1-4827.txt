Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
