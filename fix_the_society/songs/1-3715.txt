Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
