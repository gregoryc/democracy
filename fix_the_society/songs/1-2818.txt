Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
