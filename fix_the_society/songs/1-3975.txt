Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
