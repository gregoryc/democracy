Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
