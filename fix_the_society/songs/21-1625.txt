Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
