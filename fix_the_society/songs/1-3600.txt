Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
