VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
