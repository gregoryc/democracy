Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
