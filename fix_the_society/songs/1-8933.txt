Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
