Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
