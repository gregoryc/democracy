Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
