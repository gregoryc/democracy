Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
