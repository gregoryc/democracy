Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
