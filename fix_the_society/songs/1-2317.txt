VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
