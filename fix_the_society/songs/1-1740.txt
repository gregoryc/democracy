Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
