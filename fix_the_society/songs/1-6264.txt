Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
