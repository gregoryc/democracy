Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
