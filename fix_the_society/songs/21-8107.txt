Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
