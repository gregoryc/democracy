Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
