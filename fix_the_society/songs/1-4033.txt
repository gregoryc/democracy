Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
