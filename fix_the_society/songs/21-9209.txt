Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
