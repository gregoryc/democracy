Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
