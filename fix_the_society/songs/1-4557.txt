Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
