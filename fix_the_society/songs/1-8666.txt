Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
