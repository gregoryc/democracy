Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
