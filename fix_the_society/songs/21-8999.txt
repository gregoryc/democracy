Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
