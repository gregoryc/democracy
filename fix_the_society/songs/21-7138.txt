Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
