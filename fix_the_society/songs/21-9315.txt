Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
