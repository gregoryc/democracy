Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
