Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
