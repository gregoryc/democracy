Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
