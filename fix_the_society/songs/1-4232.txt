Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
