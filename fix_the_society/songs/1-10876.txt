Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
