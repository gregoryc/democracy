Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
