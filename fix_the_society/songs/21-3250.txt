Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
