Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
