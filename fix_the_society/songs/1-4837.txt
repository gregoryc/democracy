Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
