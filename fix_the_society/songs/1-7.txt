Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
