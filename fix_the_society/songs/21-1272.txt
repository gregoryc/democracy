Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
