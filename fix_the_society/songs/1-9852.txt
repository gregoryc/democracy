Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
