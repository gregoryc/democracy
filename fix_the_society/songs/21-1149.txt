Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
