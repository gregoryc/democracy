Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
