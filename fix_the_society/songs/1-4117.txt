Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
