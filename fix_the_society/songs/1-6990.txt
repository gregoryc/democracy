Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
