Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
