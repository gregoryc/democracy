Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
