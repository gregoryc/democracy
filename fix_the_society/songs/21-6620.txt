Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
