Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
