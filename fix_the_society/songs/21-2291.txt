Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
