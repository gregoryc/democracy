Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
