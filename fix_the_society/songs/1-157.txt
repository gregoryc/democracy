Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
