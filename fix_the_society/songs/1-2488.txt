Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
