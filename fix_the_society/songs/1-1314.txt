Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
