Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
