Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
