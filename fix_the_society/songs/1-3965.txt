VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
