VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
