Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
