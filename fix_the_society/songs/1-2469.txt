VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
