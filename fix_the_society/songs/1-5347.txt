Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
