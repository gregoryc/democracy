Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
