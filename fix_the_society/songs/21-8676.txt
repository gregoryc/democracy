Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
