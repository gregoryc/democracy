Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
