VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
