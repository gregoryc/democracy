Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
