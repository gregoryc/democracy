Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
