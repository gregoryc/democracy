VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
