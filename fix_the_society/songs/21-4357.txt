Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
