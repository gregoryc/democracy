Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
