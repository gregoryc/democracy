Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
