Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
