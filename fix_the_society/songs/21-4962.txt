Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
