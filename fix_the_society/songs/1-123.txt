Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
