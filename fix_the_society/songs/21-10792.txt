Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
