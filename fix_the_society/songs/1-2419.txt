Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
