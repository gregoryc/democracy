Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
