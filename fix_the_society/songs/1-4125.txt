VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
