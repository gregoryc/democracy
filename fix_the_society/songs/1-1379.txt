Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
