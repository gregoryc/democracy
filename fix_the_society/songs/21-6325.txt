Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
