Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
