Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
