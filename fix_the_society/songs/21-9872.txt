Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
