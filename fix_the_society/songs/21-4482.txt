Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
