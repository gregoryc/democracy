Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
