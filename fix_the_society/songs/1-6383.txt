Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
