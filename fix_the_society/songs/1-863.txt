Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
