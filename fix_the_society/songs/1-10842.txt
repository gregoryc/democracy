Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
