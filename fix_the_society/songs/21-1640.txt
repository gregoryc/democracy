Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
