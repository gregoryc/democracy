Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
