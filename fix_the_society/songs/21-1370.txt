Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
