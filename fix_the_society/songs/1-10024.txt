Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
