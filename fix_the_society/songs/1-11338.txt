VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
