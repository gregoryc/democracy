Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
