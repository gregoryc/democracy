Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
