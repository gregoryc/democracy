Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
