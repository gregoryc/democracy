Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
