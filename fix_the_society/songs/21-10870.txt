Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
