Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
