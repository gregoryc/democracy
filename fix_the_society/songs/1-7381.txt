Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
