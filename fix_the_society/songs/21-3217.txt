Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
