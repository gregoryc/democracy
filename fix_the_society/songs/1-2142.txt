Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
