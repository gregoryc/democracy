Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
