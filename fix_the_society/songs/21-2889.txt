Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
