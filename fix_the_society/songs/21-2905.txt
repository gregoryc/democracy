Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
