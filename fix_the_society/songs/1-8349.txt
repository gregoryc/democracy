Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
