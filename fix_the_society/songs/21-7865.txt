Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
