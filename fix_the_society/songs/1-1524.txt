Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
