Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
