Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
