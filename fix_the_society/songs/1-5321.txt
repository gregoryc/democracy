Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
