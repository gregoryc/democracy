Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
