Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
