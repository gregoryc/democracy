Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
