Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
