Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
