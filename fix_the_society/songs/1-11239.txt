Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
