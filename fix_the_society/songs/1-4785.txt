Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
