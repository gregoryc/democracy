Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
