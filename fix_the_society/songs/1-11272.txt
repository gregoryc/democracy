Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
