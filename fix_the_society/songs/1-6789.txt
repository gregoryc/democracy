Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
