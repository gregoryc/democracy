Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
