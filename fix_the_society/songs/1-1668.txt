Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
