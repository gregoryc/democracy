Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
