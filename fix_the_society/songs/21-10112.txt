Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
