Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
