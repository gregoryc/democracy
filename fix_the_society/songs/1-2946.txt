Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
