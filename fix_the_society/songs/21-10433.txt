Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
