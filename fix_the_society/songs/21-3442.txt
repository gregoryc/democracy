Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
