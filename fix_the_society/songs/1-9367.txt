Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
