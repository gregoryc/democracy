Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
