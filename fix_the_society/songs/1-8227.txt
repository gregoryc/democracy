Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
