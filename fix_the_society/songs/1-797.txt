Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
