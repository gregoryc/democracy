Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
