Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
