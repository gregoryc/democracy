VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
