Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
