Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
