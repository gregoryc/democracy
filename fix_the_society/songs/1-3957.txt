VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
