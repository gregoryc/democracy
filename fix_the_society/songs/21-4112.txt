Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
