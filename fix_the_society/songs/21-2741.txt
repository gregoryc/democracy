Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
