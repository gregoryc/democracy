Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
