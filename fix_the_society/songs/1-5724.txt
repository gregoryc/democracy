Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
