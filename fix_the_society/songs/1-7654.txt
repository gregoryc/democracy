Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

An open conversation, they always divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
