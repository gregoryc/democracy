Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
