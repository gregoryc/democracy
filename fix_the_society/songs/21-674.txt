Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
