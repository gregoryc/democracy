Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too insidious for many to detect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
