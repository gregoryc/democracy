Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
