Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
