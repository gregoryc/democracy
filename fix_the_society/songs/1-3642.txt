Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
