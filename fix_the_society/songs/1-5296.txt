Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
