Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
