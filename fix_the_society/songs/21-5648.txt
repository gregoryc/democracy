Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
