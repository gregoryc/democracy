Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
