Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
