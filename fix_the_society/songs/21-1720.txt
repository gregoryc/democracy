Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
