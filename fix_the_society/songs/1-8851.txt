Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
