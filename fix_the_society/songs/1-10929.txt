Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
