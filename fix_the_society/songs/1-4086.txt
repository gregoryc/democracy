Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
