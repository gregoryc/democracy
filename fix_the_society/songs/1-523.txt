VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
