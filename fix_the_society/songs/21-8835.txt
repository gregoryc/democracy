Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
