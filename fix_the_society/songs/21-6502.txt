Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
