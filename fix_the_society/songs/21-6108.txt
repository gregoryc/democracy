Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
