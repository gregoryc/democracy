VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
