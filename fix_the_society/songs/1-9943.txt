Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
