Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
