Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
