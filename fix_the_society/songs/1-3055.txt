Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
