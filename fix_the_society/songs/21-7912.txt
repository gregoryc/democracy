Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
