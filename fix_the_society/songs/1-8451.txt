Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
