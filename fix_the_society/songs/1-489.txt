Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
