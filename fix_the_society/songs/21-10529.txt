Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
