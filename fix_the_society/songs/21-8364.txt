Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
