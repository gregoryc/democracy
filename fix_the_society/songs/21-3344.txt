Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
