Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
