VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
