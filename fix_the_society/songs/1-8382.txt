Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is plain, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
