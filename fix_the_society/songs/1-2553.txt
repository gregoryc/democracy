Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
