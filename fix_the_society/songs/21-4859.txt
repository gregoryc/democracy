Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
