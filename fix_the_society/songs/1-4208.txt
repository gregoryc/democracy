Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is plain, anyone can detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
