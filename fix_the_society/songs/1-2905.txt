VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
