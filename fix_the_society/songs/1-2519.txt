Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
