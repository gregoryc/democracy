Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
