Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
