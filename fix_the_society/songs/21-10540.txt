Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
