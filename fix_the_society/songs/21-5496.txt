Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
