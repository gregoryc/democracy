Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
