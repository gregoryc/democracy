Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
