Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
