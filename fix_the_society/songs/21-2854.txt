Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
