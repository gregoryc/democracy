Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
