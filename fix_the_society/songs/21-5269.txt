Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
