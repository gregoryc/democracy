Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
