Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
