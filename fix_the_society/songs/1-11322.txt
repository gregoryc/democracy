Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
