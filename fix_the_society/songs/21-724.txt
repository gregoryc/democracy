Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
