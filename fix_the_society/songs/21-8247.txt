Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
