Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
