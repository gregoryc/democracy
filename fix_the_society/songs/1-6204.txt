Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
