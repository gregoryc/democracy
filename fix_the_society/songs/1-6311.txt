Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
