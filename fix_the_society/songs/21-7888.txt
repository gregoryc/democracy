Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
