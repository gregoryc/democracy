VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
