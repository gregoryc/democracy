VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
