Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
