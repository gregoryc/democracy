Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
