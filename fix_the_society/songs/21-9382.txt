Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
