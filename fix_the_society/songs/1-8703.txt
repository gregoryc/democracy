VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
