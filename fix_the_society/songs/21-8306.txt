Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
