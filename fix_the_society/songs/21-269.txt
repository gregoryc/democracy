Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
