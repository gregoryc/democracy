Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
