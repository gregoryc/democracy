Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
