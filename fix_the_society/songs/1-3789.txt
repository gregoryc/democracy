Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
