Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
