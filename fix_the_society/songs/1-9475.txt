Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
