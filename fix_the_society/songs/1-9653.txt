Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
