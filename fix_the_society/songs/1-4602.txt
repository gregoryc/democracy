Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
