VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
