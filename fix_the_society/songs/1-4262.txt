Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
