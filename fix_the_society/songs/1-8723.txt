Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
