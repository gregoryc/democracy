Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
