Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
