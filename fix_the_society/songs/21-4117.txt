Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
