Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
