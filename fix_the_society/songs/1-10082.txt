Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
