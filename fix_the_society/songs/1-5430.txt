Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
