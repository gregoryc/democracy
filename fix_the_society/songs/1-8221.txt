Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
