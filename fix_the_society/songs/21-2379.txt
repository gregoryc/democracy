Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
