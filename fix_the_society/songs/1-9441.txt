Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
