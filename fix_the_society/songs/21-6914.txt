Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
