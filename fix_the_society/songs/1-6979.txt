Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

This is plain, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

This is plain, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

This is plain, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
