Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
