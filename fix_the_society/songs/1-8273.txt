Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
