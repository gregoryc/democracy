Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
