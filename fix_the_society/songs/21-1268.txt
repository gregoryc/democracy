Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
