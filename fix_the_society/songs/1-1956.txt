Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
