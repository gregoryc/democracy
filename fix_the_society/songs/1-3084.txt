Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
