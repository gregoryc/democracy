Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
