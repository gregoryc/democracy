Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
