Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
