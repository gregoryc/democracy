Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
