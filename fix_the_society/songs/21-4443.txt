Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
