Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
