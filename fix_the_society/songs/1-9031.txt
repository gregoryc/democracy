Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
