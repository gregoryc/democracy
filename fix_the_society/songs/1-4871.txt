VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
