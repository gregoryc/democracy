Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
