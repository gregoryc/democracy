Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
