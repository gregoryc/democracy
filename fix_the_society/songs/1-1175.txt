Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
