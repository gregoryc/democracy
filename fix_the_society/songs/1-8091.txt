Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
