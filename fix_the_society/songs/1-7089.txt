Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
