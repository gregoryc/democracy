Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
