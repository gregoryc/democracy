Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
