Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
