Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
