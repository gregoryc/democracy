Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
