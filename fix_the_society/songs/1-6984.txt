Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
