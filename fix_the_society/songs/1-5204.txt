Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
