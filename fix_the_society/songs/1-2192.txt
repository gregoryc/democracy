Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
