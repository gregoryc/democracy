Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS
