Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
