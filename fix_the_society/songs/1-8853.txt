Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
