Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
