VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
