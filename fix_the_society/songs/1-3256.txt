Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
