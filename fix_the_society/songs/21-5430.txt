Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
