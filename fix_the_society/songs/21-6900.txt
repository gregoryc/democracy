Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
