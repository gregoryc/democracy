Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
