Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
