Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
