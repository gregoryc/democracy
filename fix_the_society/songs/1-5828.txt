Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
