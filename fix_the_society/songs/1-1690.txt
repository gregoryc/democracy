Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
