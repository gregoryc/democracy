Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
