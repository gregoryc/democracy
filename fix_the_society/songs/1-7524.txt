Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
