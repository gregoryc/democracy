Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
