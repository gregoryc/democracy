Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
