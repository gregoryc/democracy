Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
