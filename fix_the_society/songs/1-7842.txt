Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
