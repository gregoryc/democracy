Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
