Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
