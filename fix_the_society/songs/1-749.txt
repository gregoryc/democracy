Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
