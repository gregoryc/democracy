Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
