Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
