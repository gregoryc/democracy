Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
