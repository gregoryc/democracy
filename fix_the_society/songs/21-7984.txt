Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
