Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
