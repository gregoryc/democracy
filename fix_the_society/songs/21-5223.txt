Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
