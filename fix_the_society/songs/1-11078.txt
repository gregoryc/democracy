Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't want to test, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
