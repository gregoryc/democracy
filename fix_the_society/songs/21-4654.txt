Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
