VERSE

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
