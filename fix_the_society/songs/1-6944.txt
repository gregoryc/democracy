Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
