Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
