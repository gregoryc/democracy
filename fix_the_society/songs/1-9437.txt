VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
