Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
