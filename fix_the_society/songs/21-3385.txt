Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
