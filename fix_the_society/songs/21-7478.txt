Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
