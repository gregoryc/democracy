Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
