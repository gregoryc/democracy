Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
