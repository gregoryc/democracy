Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
