Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
