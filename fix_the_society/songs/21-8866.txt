Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
