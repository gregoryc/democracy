Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
