Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
