Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
