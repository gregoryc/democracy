Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
