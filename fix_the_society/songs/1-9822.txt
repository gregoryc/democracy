Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
