Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
