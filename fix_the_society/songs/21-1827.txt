Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
