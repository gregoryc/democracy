Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
