Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
