Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
