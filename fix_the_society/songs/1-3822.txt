Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
