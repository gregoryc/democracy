Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
