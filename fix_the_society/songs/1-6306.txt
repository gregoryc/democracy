Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
