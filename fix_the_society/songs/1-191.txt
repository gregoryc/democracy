Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
