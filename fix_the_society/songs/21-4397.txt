Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
