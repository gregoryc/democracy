Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS
