Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
