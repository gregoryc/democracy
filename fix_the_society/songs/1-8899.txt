Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
