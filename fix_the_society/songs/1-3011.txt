VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
