Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
