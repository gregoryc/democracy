Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
