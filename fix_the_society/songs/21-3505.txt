Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
