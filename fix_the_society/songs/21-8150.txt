Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
