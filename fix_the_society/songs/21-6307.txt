Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
