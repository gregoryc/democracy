Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
