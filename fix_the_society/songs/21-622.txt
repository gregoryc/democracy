Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
