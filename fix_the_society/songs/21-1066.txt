Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
