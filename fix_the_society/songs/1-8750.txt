Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
