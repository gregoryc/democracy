Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
