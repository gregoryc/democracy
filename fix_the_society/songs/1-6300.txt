Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
