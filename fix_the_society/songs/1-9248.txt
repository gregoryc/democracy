VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
