Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
