Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
