Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
