Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
