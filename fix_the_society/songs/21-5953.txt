Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
