Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
