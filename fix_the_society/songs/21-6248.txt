Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
