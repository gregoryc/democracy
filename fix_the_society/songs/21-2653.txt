Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
