Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
