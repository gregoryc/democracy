Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
