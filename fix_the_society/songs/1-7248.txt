Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
