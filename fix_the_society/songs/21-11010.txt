Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
