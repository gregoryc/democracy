VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
