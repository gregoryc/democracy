Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
