Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
