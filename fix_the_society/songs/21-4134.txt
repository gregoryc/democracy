Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
