Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
