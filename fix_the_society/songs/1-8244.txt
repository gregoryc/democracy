Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
