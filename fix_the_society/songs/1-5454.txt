VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
