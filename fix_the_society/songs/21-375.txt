Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
