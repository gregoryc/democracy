Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
