Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
