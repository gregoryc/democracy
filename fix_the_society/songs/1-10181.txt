Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
