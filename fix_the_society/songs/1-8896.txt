Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
