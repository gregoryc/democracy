Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
