Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
