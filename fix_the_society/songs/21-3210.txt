Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
