Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
