Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
