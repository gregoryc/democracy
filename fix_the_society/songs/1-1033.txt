Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
