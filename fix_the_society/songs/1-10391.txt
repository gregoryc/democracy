VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
