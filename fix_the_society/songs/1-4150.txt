Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
