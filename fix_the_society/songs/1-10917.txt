Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
