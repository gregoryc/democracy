VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
