Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
