Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
