Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
