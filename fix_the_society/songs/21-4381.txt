Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
