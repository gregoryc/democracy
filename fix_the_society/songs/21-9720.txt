Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
