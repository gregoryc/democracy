Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
