Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS
