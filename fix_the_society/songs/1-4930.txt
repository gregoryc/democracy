Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
