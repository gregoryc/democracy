Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
