Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
