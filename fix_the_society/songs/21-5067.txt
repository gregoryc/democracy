Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
