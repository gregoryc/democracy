Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
