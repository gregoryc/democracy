Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
