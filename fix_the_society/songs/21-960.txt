Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
