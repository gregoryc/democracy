Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
