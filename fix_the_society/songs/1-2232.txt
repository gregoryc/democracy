Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
