Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
