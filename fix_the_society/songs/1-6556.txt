Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
