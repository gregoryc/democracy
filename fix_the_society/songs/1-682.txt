Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
