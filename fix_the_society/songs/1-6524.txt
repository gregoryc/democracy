Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
