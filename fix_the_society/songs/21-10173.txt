Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
