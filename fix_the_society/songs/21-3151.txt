Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
