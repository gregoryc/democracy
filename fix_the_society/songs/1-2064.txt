Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
