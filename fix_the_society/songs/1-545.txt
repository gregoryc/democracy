Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
