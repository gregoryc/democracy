Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
