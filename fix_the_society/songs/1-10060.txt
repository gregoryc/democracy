Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
An open conversation, they always divert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
