Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
