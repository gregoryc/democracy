Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
