Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
