Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
