Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
