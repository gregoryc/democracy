Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
