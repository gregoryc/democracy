Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
