VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
