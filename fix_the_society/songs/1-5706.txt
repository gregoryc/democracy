Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
