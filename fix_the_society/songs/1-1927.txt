Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
