Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
