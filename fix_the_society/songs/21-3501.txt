Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
