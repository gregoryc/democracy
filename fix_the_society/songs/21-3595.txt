Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
