Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
