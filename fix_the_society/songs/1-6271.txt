Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
