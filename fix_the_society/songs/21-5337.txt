Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
