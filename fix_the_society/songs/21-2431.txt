Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
