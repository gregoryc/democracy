Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
