Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
