Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
