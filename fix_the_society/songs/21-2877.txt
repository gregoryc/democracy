Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
