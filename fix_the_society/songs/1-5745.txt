Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
