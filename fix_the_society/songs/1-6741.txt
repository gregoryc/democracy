VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
