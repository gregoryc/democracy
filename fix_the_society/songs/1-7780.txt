VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
