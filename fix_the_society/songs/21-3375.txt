Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
