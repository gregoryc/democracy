Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
