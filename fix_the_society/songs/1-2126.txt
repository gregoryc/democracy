Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
