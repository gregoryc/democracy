Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
