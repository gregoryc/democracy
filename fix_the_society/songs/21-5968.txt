Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
