Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
