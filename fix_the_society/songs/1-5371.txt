VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
