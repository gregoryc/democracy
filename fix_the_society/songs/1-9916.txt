Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
