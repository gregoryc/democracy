Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
