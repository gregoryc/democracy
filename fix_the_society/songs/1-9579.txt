Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
