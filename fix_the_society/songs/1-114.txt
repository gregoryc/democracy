VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
