VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
