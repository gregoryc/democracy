Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
