Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
