Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
