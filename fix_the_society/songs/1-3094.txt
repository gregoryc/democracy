Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
