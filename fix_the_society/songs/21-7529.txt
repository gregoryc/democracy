Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
