Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
