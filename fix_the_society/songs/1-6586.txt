Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
