Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
