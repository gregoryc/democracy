Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
