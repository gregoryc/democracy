Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
