Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
