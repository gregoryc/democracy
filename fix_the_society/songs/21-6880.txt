Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
