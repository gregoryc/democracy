Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
