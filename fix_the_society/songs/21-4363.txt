Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
