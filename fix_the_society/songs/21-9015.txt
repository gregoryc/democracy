Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
