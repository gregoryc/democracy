Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
