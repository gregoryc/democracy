Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
