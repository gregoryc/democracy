VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
