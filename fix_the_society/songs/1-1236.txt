Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
