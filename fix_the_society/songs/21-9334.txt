Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
