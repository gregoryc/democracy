Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
