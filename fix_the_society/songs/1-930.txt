VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
