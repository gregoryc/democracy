Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
