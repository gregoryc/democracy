Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
