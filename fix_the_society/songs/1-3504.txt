Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
