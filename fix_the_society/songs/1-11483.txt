Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
