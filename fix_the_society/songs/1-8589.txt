Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
