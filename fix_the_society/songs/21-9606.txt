Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
