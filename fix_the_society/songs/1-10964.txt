Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
