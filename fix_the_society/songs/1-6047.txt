Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
