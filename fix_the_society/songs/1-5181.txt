Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
