Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
