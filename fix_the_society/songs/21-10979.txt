Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
