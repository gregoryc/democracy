Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
