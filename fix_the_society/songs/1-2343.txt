Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
