Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
