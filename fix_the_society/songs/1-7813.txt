Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
