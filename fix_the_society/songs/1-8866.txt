Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
