Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
