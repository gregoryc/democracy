Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
