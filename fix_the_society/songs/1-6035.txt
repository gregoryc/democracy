VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
