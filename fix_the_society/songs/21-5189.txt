Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
