Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
