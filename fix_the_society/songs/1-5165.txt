Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
