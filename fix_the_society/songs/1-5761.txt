Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
