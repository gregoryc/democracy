VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
