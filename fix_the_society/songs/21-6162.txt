Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
