Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
