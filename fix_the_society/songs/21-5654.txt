Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
