VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
