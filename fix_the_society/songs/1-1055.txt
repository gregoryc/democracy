Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
