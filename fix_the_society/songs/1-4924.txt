Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
