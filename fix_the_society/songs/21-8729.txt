Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
