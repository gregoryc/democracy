Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
