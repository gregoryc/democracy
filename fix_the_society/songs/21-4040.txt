Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
