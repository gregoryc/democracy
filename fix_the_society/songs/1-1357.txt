Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
