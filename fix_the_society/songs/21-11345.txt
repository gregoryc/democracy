Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
