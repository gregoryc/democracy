Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
