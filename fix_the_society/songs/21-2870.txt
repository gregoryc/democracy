Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
