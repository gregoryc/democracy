Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
