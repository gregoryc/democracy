Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
