Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
