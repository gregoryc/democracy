Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
