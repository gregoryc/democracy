Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
