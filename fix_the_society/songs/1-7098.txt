Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
