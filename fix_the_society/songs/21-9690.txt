Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
