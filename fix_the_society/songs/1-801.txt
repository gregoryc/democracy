Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
