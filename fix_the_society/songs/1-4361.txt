Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
