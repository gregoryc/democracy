Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
