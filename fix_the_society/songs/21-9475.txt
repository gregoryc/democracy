Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
