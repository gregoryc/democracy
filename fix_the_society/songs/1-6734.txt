Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
