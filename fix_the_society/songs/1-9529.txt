VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
