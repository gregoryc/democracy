Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
