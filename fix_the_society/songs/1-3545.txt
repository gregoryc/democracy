Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
