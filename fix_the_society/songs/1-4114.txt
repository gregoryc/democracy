VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
