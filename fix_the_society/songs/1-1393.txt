Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
