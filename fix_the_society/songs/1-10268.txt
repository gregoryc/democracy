Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
