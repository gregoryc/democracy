Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
