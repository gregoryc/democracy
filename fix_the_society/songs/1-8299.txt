Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
