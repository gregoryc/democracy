Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
