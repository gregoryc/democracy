Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
