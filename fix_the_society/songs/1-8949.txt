Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
