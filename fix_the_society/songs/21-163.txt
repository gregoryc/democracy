Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
