VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
