Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
