Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
