Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
