Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
