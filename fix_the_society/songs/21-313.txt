Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
