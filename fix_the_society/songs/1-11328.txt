Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
