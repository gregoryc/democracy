Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
