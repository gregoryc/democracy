Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
