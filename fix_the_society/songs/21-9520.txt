Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
