Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
