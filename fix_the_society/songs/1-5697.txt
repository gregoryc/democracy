Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
