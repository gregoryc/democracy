Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
