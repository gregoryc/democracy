Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
