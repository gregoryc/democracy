Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
