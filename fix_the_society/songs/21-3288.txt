Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
