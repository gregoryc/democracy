Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
