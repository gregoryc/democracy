Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
