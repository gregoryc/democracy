Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
