Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
