Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
