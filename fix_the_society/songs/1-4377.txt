Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
