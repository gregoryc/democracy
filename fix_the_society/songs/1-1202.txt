Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
