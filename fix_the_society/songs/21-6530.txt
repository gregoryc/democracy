Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
