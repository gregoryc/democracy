Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
