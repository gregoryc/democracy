Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
