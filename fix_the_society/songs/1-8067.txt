Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
