VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
