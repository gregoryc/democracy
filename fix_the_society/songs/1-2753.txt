Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
