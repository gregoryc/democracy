Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
