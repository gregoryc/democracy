Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
