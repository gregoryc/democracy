Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
