Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
