VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
