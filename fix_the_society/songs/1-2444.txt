Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
