Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
