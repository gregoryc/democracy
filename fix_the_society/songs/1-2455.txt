Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
