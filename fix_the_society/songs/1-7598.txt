Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
