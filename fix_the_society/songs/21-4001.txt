Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
