Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
