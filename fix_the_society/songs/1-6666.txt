Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
