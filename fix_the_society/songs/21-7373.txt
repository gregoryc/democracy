Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
