Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
