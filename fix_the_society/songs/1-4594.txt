Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
