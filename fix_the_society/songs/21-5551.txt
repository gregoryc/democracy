Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
