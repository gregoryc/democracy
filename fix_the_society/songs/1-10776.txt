Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
