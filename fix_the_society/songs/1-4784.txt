Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

This is plain, anyone can detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
