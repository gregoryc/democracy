Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
