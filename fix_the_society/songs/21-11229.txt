Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
