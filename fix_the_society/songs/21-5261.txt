Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
