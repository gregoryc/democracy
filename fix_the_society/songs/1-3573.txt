Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
