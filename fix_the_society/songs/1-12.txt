Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
