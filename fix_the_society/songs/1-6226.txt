VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
