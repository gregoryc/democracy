Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
