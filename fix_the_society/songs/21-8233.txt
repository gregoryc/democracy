Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
