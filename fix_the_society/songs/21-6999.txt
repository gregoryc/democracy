Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
