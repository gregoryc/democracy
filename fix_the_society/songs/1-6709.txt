Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
