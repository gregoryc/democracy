Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
