Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
