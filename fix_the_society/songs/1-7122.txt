VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
