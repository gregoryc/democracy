Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
