VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
