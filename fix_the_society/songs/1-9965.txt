Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
