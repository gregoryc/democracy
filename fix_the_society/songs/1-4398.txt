Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
