Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
