Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
