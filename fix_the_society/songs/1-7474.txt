Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
