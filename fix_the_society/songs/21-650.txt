Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
