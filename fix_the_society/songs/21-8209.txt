Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
