Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
