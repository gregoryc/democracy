Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
