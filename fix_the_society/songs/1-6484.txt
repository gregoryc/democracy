VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
