Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
