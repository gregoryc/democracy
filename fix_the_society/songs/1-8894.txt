Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
