VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
