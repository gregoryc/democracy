Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
