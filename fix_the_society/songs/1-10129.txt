Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
