Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
