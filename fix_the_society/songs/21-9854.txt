Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
