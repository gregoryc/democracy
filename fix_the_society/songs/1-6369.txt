Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
