Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
