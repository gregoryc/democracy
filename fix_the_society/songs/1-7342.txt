Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
