Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
