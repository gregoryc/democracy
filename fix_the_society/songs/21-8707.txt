Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
