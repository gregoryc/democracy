VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
