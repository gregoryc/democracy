Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
