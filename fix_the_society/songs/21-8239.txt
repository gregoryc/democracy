Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
