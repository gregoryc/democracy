Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
