Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
