Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
