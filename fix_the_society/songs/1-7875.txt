Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
