Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
