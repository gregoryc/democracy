Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
