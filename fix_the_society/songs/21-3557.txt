Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
