Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
