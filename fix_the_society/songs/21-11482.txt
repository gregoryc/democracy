Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
