Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
