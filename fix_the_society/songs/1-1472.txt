Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
