Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
