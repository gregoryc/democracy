Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
