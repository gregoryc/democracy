Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
