Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
