Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
