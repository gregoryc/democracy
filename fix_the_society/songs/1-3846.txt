Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
