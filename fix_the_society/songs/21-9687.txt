Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
