VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
