Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
