Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
