Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
