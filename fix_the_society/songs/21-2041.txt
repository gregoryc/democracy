Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
