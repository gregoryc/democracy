Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
