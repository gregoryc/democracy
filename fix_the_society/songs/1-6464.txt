Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
