Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
