Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
