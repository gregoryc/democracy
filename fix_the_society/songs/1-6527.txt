Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
