Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
