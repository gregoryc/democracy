Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
