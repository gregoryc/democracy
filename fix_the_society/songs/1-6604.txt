Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
