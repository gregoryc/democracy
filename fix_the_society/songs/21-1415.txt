Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
