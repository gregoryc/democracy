Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
