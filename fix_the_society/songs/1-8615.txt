Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
