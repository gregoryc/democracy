Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
