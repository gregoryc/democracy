Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
