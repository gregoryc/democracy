Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
