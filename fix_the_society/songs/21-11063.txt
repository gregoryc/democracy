Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
