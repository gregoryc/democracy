Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
