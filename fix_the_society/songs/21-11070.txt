Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
