Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
