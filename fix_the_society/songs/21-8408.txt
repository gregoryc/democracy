Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
