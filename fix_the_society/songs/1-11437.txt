VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is obvious, anyone can detect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
