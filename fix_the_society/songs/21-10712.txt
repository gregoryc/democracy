Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
