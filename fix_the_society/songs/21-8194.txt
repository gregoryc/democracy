Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
