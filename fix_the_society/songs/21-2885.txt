Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
