Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
