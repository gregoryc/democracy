Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
