Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
