Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
