Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
