Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
