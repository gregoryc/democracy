Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
