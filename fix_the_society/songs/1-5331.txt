Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
