Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
