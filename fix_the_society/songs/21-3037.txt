Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
