Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
