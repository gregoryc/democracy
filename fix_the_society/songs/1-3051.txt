Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
