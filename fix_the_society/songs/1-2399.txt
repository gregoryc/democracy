Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
