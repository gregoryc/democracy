Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
