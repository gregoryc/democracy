VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
