Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
