Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
