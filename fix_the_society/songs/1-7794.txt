Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
