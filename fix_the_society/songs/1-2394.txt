Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
