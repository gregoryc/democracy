Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
