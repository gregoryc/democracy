Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
