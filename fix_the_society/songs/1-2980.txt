VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
