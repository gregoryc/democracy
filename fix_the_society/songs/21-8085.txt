Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
