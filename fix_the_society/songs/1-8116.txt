Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
