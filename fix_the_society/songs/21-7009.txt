Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
