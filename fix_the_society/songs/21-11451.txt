Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
