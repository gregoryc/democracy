Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
