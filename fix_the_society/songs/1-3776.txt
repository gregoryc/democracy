Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
