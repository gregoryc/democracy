Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
