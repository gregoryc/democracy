Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
