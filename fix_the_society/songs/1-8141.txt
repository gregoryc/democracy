VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
