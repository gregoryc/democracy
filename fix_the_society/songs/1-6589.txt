Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
