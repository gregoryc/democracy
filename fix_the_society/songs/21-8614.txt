Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
