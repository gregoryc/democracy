Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
