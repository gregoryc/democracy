Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
