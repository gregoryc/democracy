Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
