Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
