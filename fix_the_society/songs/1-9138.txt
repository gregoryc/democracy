Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
