Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
