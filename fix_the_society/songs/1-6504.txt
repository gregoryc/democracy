Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
