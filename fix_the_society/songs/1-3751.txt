Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
