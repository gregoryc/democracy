Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
