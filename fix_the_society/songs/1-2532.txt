Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
