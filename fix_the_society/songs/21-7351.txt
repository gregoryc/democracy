Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
