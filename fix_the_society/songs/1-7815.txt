Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
