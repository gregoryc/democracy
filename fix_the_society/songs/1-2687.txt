Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
