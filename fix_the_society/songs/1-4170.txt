VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
