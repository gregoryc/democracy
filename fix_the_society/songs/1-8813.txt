Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
