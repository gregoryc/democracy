Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
