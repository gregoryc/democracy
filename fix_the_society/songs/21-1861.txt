Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
