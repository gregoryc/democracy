Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
