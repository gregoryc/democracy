Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
