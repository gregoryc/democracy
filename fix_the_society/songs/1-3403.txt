Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
