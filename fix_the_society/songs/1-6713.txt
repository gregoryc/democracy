Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
