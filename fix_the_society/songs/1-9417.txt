Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
