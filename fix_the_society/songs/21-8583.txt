Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
