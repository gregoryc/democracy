Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is plain, anyone can detect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
