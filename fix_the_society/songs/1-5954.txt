Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
