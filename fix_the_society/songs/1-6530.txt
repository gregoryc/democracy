Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is plain, anyone can detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
