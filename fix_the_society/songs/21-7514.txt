Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
