Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
