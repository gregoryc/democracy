Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
