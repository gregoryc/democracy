Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
