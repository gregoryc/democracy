Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Science is  fundamentally inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
