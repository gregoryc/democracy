Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
