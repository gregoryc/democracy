Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
