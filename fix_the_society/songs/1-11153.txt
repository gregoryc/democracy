Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
