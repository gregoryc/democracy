Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS
