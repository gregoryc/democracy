VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
