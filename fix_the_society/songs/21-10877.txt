Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
