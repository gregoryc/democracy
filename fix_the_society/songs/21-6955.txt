Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
