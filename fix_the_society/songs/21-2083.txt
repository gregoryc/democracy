Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
