Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
