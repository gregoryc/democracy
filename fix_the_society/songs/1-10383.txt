Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
