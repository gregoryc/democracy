Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
