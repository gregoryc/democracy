Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
