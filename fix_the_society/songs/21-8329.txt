Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
