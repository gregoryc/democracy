Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
