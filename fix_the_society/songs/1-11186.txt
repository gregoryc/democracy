VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
