Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
