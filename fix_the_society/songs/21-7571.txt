Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
