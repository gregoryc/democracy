Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
