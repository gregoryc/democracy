Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
