Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
