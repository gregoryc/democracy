Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
