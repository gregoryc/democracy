Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
