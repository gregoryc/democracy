Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
