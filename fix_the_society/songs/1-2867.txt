Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
