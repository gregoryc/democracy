VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
