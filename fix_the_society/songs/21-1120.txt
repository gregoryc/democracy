Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
