Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
