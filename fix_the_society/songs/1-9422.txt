VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
