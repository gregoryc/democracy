Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
