Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
