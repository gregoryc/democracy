Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
