Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
