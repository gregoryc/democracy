Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
