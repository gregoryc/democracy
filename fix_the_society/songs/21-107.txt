Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
