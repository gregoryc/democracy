Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
