Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and moaning like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
