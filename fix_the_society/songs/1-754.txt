Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
