Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
