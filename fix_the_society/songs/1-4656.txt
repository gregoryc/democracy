VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
