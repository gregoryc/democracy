Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
