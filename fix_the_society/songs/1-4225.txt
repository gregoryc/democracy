Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
