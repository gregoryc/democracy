Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
