Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
