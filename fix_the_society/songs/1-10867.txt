Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
