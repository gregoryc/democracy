Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
