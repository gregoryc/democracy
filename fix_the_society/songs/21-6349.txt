Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
