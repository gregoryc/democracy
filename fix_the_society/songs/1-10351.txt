VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
