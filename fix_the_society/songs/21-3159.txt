Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
