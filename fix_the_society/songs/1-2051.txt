Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
