Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
