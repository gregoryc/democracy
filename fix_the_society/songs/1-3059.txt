Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
