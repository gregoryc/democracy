Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
