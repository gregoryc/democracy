Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
