Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
