Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
