Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
