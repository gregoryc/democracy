Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
