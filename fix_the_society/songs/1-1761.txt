Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
