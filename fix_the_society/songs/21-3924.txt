Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
