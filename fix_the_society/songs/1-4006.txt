Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
