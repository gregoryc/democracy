Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
