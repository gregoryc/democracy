Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
