Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
