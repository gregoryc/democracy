Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
