Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
