Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
