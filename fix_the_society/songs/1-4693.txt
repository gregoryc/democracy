Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
