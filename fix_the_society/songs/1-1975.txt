Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
