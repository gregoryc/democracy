Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
