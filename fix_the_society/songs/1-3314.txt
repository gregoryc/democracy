Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
