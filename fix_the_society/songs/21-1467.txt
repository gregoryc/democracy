Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
