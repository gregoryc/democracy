Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and complaining like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
