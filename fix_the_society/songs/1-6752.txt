Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
