Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
