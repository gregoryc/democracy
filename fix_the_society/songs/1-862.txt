Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
