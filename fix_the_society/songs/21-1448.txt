Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
