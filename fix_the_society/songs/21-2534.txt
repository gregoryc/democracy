Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
