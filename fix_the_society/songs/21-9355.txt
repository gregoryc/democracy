Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
