Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
