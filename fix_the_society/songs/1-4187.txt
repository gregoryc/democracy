Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
