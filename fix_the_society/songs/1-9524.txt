Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
