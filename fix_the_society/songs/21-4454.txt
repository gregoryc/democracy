Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
