Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
