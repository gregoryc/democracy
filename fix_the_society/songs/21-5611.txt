Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
