Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
