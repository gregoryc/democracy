Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
