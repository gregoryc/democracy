Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
