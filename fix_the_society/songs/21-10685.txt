Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
