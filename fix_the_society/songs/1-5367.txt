Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
