Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
