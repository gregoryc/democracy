Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
