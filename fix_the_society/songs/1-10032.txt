VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
