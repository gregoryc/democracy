VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
