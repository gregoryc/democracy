Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
