Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
