Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
