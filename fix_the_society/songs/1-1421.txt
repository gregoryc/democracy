Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
