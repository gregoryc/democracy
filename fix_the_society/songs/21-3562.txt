Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
