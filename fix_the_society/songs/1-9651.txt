Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
