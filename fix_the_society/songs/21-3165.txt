Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
