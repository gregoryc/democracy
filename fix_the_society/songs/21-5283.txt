Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
