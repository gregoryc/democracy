Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
