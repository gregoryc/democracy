Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
