Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
