Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
