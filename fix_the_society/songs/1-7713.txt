Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
