Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
