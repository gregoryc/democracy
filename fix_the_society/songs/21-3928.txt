Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
