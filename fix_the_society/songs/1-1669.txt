Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
