Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
