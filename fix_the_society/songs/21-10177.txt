Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
