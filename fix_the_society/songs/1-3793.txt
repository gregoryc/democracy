Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
