Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
