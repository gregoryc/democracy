Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
