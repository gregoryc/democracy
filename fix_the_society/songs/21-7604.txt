Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
