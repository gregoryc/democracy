Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
