Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
