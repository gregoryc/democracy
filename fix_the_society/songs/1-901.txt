Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
