Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
