Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
