Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
