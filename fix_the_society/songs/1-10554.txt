Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
