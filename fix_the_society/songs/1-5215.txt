Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
