Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
