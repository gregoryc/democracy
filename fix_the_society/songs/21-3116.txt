Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
