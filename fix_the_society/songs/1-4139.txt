VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
