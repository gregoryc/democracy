Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
