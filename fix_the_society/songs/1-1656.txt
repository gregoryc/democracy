Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
