Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
