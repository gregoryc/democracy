Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
