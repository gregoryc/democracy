Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
