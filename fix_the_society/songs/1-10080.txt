Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
