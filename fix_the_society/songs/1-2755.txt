Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
