Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
