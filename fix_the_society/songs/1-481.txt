Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
