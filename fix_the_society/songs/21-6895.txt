Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
