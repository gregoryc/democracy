Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
