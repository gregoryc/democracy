Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
