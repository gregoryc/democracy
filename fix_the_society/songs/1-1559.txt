Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
