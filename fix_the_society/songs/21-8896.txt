Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
