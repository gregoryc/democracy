Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
