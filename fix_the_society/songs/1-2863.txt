Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
