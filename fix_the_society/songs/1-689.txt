VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
