Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
