Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
