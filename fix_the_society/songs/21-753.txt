Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
