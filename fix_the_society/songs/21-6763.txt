Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
