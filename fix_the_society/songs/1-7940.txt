Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
