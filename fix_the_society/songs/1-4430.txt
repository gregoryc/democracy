Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
