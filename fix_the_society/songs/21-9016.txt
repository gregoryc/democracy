Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
