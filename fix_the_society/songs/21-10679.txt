Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
