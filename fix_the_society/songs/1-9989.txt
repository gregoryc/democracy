Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Science is  fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
