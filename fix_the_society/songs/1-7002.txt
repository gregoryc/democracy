Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
