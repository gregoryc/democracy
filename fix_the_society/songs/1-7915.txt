Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
