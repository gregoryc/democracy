VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
