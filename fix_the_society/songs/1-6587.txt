Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
