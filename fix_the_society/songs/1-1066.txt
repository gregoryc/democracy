Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
