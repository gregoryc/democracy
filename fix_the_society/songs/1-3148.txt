Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
