Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
