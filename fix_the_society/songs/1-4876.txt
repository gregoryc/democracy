VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
