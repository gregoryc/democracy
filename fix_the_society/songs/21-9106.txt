Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
