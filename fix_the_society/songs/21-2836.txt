Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
