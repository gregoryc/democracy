Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
