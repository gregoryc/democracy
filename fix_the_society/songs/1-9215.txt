Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This is plain, anyone can detect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is plain, anyone can detect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
