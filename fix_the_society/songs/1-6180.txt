Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
