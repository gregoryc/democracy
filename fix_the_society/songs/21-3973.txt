Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
