Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
