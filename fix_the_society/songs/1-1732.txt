VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
